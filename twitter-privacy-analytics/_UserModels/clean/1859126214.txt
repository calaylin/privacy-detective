1859126214_399620290029686784 x	Bad effort again. Eagles playing very poorly today.
1859126214_399618734005821440 x	Can Henery do IT????? Can he make a FG?????
1859126214_399618426961817600 x	Apparently, they brought back the replacement refs to do this game
1859126214_399617393460125696 x	Outside runs just not working for the Eagles since Vick got hurt. Run inside more or pass more.
1859126214_399613826204569601 x	I don't trust Henery to make a big kick and at the end of the day, that is the most important thing for a kicker.

1859126214_399616020194672640 x	The Eagles need to get pressure up the middle. Best place to get pressure on young QB. Force them out of the pocket.
1859126214_399615071141130240 x	Don't care if they are winning. The Eagles don't deserve to win this game playing like this. Unacceptable.
1859126214_399613477834067968 x	Henery absolutely sucks.
1859126214_399612641133334530 x	Unacceptable effort by the Eagles so far. Can't use injuries as an excuse.
1859126214_399610026030923776 x	No excuse for the Eagles. The Packers are on their 3rd QB. By far the most important position on the field. It's even steven.
1859126214_399608383554088961 x	I'm tired of Peters. He's made of glass. Would look to upgrade for next season.

1859126214_398982479413264384 x	RT @SportsnetSpec: Oilers are crazy for Wayne Simmonds. I believe they would move a smaller right winger - Eberle or Yakupov - to acquire.
1859126214_398977847919796224 x	I'd love Eberle, but EDM would have to go full jackass mode to do it.I'd love Yakupov too. Apparently EDM loves Simmonds and he'd be in deal
1859126214_398979389724950529 x	@AdamReigner Another said EDM is in love with Simmonds and desires him. Another said if they can't get Eberle, Flyers would want Yakupov

1859126214_398943025373528065 x	Unless Foles has the absolute epically bad game he had against Dallas all over again. Just don't think GB can outscore Eagles otherwise.
1859126214_398942781361487872 x	I think key to Eagles/Packers is their offensive line. With Wallace, they won't be able to outscore Eagles if Foles gets good protection

1859126214_398560411907137536 x	@jords_mac The Phils won't have to surrender a 1st round pick since they are picking 7th in the draft. Not a worry this yr. I want Tanaka
1859126214_398561935848779776 x	@jords_mac It's not Tanaka vs Price. It's Tanaka vs giving away almost your entire farm for Price. Phils would have to give Franco. Bad idea
1859126214_398562982575087617 x	@jords_mac Phils already have two aces. Their resources should be spent on improving the offense. Price is an unncessesary luxury(cont)

1859126214_397540764927799296 x	@mharrisCSN None. Losing games is still for the best, despite the 3 win mirage. They need Wiggins, Parker, or Randle.

1859126214_397518512324751362 x	ESPN's MNF pre-game is the biggest waste of time of anything ever. Break it down for hours from 50 mil angles & it never turns out that way
1859126214_397519028261879810 x	@MongoGoesCrazy I agree. I never watch them.
1859126214_397518017086496768 x	@ryanlawrence21 Phils don't have many spots to upgrade. C/RF are about it. Bc of that, you think maybe Revere could be on the outs?
1859126214_397518835554607104 x	@ryanlawrence21 I'm hoping so. Adding Nelson Cruz and re-signing Chooch isn't enough of an upgrade for the offense IMO. They need more punch
1859126214_397517722520526849 x	I love Molly Sullivan, she's gorgeous. She talks way too robotic though. Always hated that about reporters. It's 2013, talk normal.
1859126214_397513208262443008 x	@jimlynn321 Probably. The Warriors are good. They can shoot he lights out and Curry is ridiculous. Some tough games coming up.
1859126214_397501206370594817 x	Knew going into the last two offseasons we were headed for dark days.This season is the last straw.Screw it up and I'm out until RAJ's fired
1859126214_397500664105795584 x	Just adding a Nel Cruz isn't gonna cut it. Offense was abysmal. Not many positions to upgrade other than CF. RAJ loves Revere tho.He sucks.
1859126214_397500183950286848 x	Stuff I heard from Salisbury on WIP today about Phils was much akin to the last two offseasons. Not going after the big bats. #sameoldstory
1859126214_397101613669548032 x	As far as I'm concerned, it's the Broncos and then everyone else. Man, there are a lot of bad or mediocre teams in the NFL this year
1859126214_397499470591455232 x	@MongoGoesCrazy With Tom Brady they are always scary, but their defense isn't great and they don't have the weapons in my opinion
1859126214_397498874283044864 x	The countdown to another disastrous offseason is at just under 6 hours! Join the fun! #worstGMinbaseball
1859126214_397498671073206272 x	Everyone prepared to see Ruben Amaro Jr fuck up another offseason? #FireAmaro

1859126214_397493139427962880 x	@BaseballJorge Salta & Nolasco both suck. Neither really any type of upgrade over what they have.
1859126214_397478354753818624 x	Asomugha sucks. Everyone saw that with the Eagles. If anyone gives him a job again, it's for name only. Slow and bad instincts.
1859126214_397201547995512833 x	@AdamReigner I was very impressed, but he has to couple it with more big games. If he sucks against GB, Foles just another inconsistent QB
1859126214_397203317983416320 x	@AdamReigner Certainly not. Unless he plays extremely well the rest of the way, I still want another QB in the first round.
1859126214_397200823534379008 x	@jollywipradio Ellsbury gets injured a lot and will probably get 100 million. Don't you think it's a very risky signing?
1859126214_397178640997183488 x	Don't understand why anyone in the NFL would have long dreads. It gives you a disadvantage as players can grab without penalty. Fuck style
1859126214_397168971629072384 x	Chip Kelly's offense works if the players execute. Always has, always will. Laughing at the short-sighted reactionary idiots from last week
1859126214_397165568773480449 x	You won't hear from all the losers who said Chip isn't cut out for the NFL this week. They're too busy riding the Gus Bus into a firy crash
1859126214_397163471739310080 x	RT @ESPNStatsInfo: Via @eliassports Nick Foles is the first player in NFL history to throw for seven touchdowns within the first three quar?
1859126214_397146601967210496 x	Pryor that fast, the LBs that slow, or both?
1859126214_397145486533992448 x	Eagles a different team on the road. It makes no sense. It's actually infuriating they can't play this way at home.
1859126214_397114596395208704 x	For those that don't know, the PBP man Chris Myers is the same idiot that ruined Ian Johnson's proposal when Boise beat Oklahoma
1859126214_397114324780478464 x	lol, hold a WR when the QB is running backwards. Smart
1859126214_397112046673612800 x	Chrishhh Myershhhh. TyouchhhDyooown. Brent Sheeeleeeek. Eagles LEAD Sheeeven noothing
1859126214_397111453838106624 x	I'm Chris Myers, I talk like Chris Hanson. Nick Foleshhh Firstshh Dyooown
1859126214_397110975079276544 x	Chris Myers is such a douchebag.
1859126214_397109952541519872 x	Let's see what Chip has cooked up on offense!!! Whaddaya got Chip?!?!?!?!
1859126214_397109035716988928 x	One of the worst rules in pro sports. OMG GOTTA PROTECT THE PUNTER!!
1859126214_397108363974025216 x	Horrible play calling by SD. Just awful.
1859126214_397106928972599297 x	If the Eagles lose today, time to root for the a draft pick, because Dallas will be 2 games up and it's over.
1859126214_397103146540871680 x	Why doesn't NFL Red Zone have the Cowboys/Vikings game on? Stop showing this Titans/Rams game. It's boring
1859126214_397102191174885376 x	@KNegandhiESPN @ChrisBurke_SI Goodell's NFL!
1859126214_397101501622919168 x	Goodell's NFL at work in the Jets game! Pathetic
1859126214_397096773149155328 x	lol the Chiefs are such frauds. Scored two defensive TDs today. They won't win anything with that brutal offense
1859126214_397095083851268097 x	The only negative about NFL Red Zone: I hate when they cut in to red zone games that no one cares about. Bad teams or blowouts
1859126214_397092884513443840 x	Awful awful call in the Vikings/Cowboys game. Wow. Just wanted to make sure he was down. I hate the concussion rules. HATE them
1859126214_397092714115641344 x	@MoveTheSticks Followed by a terrible one
1859126214_397091502196654081 x	The Jets are a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde team if I've ever seen one.
1859126214_397088289292705792 x	@jodymacman What do you think about the Phils losing out on McDowell? Think he used the Phils as leverage to get better deal from Atlanta?
1859126214_397086433971671040 x	Horrible play call by Buffalo and Big Daddy is ENRAGED
1859126214_397084768602300416 x	Liked Dallas -9.5 this week, but glad they are laying an egg anyway. Man, this division sucks. Can't remember when it was this bad.
1859126214_396919421148463104 x	Steve from Glenside talking out of his ass. I was always perfectly fine about taking long to take a coach and criticized people that weren't
1859126214_397084087380230144 x	@jimlynn321 They took their time and made the right move. He seems to be an excellent coach. Hinkie is a shrewd guy it seems. Good GM
1859126214_397083927854063616 x	@jimlynn321 Hope you are right. Eagles fans need something to be happy about. If Foles plays well they have a great shot. Simple key to game
1859126214_396921222170017792 x	for the record, the tanking process isn't proven right or wrong until years after the fact when everything plays out. It certainly hasnt yet
1859126214_396920189050032128 x	Just mocked people that whined about the hiring process with Adam mere minutes before as a matter of fact. Don't make shit up
1859126214_396893264063643648 x	@jimlynn321 Money well spent. Glad you enjoyed the game. It was a fun game, but I have tunnel vision on Wiggins.
1859126214_396893108735991810 x	@jimlynn321 One of those games where if the Skins lay an egg, stay away from em for a while. Hard betting year. So many mediocre teams
1859126214_396812058563317761 x	I hate this team. What the fuck are they doing?
1859126214_396816243946057728 x	@jimlynn321 Enjoy it while it's happening. They play very hard.
1859126214_396815785814810624 x	Absolutely disgusting. The Sixers will not win a championship in my lifetime and I'm not even 30 yet.
1859126214_396810781678788608 x	Derrick Rose has an elastic band growing out of his neck
1859126214_396737909568450560 x	Phils can't even steal McDowell away from Braves. What a terrible organization this has become. Done nothing right in 2 years.
1859126214_396733450679369728 x	@AdamSchefter Coaching is a high stress job. I wonder if doctors will recommend him taking the rest of the season off. Can't be good for him
1859126214_396717786161889280 x	Temple gonna Temple
1859126214_396570312331890690 x	A lot of the future of Philly sports rides on the next several months. Phils free agency, NBA lotto, Eagles get their QB? Hope for the best
1859126214_396567494132916224 x	@jimlynn321 The Sixers +9 is promising, but be careful bc Sixers might be fool's gold, and Bulls very good when clicking. Not clicking yet.
1859126214_396567027839553536 x	@jimlynn321 Sixers could very well win that game. Hard to judge, bc dunno what to make of 6ers yet.I'm a Wiggins guy tho,so 3-0 would be UGH
1859126214_396566649983074304 x	@jimlynn321 Thanks. I like Skins a TINY bit too,but not a lot. Theyre not great, but SD inconsistent on road. Liked Bills if Lewis plays
