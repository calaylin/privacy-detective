227889353_396450292335906816 x	The #Sixers are 2-0. About one-fifth of the way to their projected win total for the season.
227889353_396437044098265088 x	6-0 without any Ovechkin? This is ugly. #Flyers
227889353_394477565655937024 x	Good for him. RT @AdamSchefter: A trade for Cards WR Larry Fitzgerald will be in play this off-season.
227889353_391582308631076864 x	?@WealthyWalrus: For $30,000... Would you drink out of an unflushed public toilet with a straw?" Didn't we hav this convo? Lol @marycallum
227889353_381078187809472512 x	Michael Vick really pulled a throwback Thursday yesterday. The 61 yard run was the longest of his career.
227889353_370676594849107968 x	Ridiculous. RT @EliotShorrParks: Here is the game-by-game breakdown of ESPN's #Eagles predictions. http://t.co/Xe4F1qrvjz
227889353_366212722511192066 x	ARod received a mix of boos and cheers yesterday. Why would anyone cheer for him?
227889353_361462444666789888 x	When Brucie finishes the whole cake in Matilda is one of the most triumphant moments in film history. It gets me every time.
227889353_361198572491911168 x	Team says Maclin's right knee is still being evaluated. Any word of an ACL tear is a complete guess, ignore it until there is official word.
227889353_361182791632826368 x	Maclin carted off practice field. Right leg injury, no word on what it is. Lets just hope it isn't serious. #Eagles
227889353_352619534760427520 x	My cheeto looks like a walking person... http://t.co/QV8FMfFKf1
227889353_351910689079701504 x	Need to stop watching Buying Alaska. I'm about to move there now.
227889353_351402393663057920 x	I tweeted about Bradley Cooper yesterday and neglected to mention his awesomeness in The Hangover movies. I'm ashamed of myself.
227889353_350997104883269633 x	This headache needs to go away now.
227889353_350523486575411200 x	Just woke up to someone pulling my arm really hard. Look around, nobody. Sister is downstairs, I'm upstairs alone. #ghosts
227889353_346341893573050368 x	I don't always crave Chick Fil A, but when I do, it is Sunday.
227889353_339815737919148034 x	I have a pocket watch and now I feel awesome.
227889353_339824736546734080 x	@RICH74177188 boom. http://t.co/sODuBms1Gg
227889353_339095718558040066 x	Now I can see why this is the greatest city in the world. #NYC
227889353_338776707123253248 x	I need some names for characters in my new book. Thoughts?
227889353_331901954823434240 x	Making it imperative to cite everything in a college paper really limits your intellectual ability. Can't just connect the dots on your own.
227889353_330406474088062976 x	"Hospital?" "Trashcan." "Sweet! Thanks buddy." #HotRod
227889353_316590175218192384 x	Taking a few weeks off of sports writing to work on my book. Will be back at it before NFL Draft time though!
227889353_314882800534831104 x	Oregon over OK State, got it!
227889353_312792216668086272 x	History of Rap 4, @jimmyfallon and @jtimberlake are legendary.
227889353_312666855464656896 x	RT @Eagles: #Eagles acquire Arrelious Benn and a 7th-rd pick from Tampa Bay in exchange for a 6th-round pick and a conditional pick in 2014.
227889353_312294423989981184 x	RT @Eagles: #Eagles agree to terms with S Kenny Phillips (1-year deal) and CB Cary Williams (3-year deal). -- GREAT signings here. Love it.
227889353_312004043629281281 x	Wow, Jrue just made the Birdman look silly. #Sixers
227889353_311996855846330368 x	Gym tonight for the first time in I don't even know how long! Lets hope I make it out alive.
227889353_311621177514811392 x	Probably obvious but someone with the #Eagles told me that there is a lot more going on than what's on the surface. Keeping things quiet.
227889353_311584245959241729 x	James Casey news doesn't surprise me. With new offense I knew Celek would be expendable. Big FA and draft class for TE. #Eagles
227889353_311586614885380096 x	@RICH74177188 Harbor isn't going anywhere, Celek probably though.
227889353_311588779053940736 x	@RICH74177188 Good question. Maybe Miami if they have the money.
227889353_311567252543651841 x	Yes, I am five. http://t.co/FukqkDlqdy
227889353_311562647587930112 x	?@Jeff_McLane: Nnamdi Asomugha was released by the #Eagles.? FINALLY
227889353_311544867715174400 x	?@AdamSchefter: RT @TomPelissero: BREAKING: #Vikings just released Antoine Winfield.? Aaaaand another one. #Eagles
227889353_308416325791924224 x	I plan on being a published author by my senior year. Still figuring out an idea, wish me luck!
227889353_303281557131653122 x	Muuuuuuch needed nap then up for radio at 1:20 and probably a while after that.
227889353_396100804660457472 x	Grimes went to Northeast HS. I always love cheering for the Philly guys around the NFL.
227889353_394496949606690816 x	Call in last night's World Series was a complete miscall. Worse than Seahawks-Packers last-play call considering scale. Sorry @Garrett_Roux
227889353_390979256375062528 x	My brother had a free ticket to the Flyers game tonight and didn't go because he "didn't feel like it." You're no brother of mine...
227889353_373249066182127616 x	Thank god out starting receivers can catch the ball. These backups have stone hands. #Eagles
227889353_373232627752660993 x	Don't let the stats fool you. Foles is playing well behind a crappy line. Receivers have stone hands tonight (Salas, Harbor, Ertz).
227889353_373229061126250496 x	Jaiquawn Jarrett is being played the way he should. Up in the box, not in defensive backfield. Good job by the #Jets.
227889353_373223627120197632 x	#Jets players on that Foles sack-fumble? Jaiquawn Jarrett and Ricky Sapp. Both former #Eagles.
227889353_371844766339592192 x	Happy birthday to my old man, @Richpedd1!! He's only like 93 or something.
227889353_366086374434152448 x	Those FeedThePig commercials are terrifying.
