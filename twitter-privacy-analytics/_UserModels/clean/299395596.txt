299395596_395357300560756736 x	@CliftonEddie vetri. The last name is Italian.  You can't be that stupid!
299395596_395358229683003392 x	@CliftonEddie funny, if someone likes something you can't face facts. Why is that?
299395596_380063517274935296 x	Some interesting news coming soon!
299395596_377145839850098688 x	@CliftonEddie not going there
299395596_376374887289331712 x	Me and Glen Macnow of WIP fame going toe to toe on pizza. Starting at PIzza Vetri and then his fave Taconellis. Stay tuned.
299395596_375687434476208129 x	In Philly? Pizzeria Vetri is amazing. Best pies you have ever eaten. Grand Opening tomorrow. I just got a sneak peek and I will be back soon
299395596_375780288779259904 x	@dsn112 you apparently have no idea about good pizza
299395596_375809098052550656 x	@dsn112 hey man, give me a break. I am bicoastal and don't know all these little cute phrases. Be more explicit. Seems our tastes differ
299395596_376011707262717952 x	@RealBradWesley Vetri is not Italian?  Yes he is. Do your homework genius
299395596_376104288134889472 x	@RealBradWesley just read reviews on Gaetanos. You can't be serious. So much grease the pizza has pimples!
299395596_376238443577499648 x	@RealGlenMacnow opening night at Vetri tonite he completely sold out of pizzas !  I rest my case.
299395596_376333898613280768 x	@RealGlenMacnow yes sir. Over rated. Paper plates. Really?  Order dough ahead?  Pretentious at best. Vetri sold out at 9:30 last night
299395596_376351085944127488 x	@RealGlenMacnow poor attitude in the restaurant
299395596_376357948605616128 x	@RealGlenMacnow want to discuss on the radio?
299395596_376369569213853696 x	@RealGlenMacnow on a shoot. Need the number
299395596_376373651492175872 x	@RealGlenMacnow you guys are great!  Looking forward to the challenge.
299395596_376334076124606464 x	@CliftonElite absolutely not true. I wish I was a partner
299395596_376336858231607296 x	@CliftonElite delco times must have poor journalists. I have no investment.
299395596_376350671458795520 x	@CliftonElite @Ibatvmc @delcotimes really?  And they said I was a silent partner and that is a lie. Where did u get your info?
299395596_376352137326112768 x	@CliftonEddie they sold out by 9:30 last night. Keep that in mind. Others obviously agree with me
299395596_376354836188762113 x	@CliftonElite what do u do?
299395596_376353235336171521 x	@DennisDeitch Dennis ?  Did u tell someone I am an investor in Pizzeria Vetei?
299395596_376355044721192960 x	@DennisDeitch some guy on the web said you told him I was. So you never did?
299395596_376357993627267072 x	@DennisDeitch my apologies
299395596_376171086205169664 x	@RealGlenMacnow been there. Just ok. Way to much attitude. Paper plates tossed at me. Ordering the dough ahead. Not for me
299395596_376111363464380416 x	@RealBradWesley name the time and place
