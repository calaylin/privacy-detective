371915020_391211982721789953 x	@TheePcue pretty much never seeing as its one dynasty after another
371915020_382277414186803200 x	@TheePcue too busy blowing teams out 90% of the time. Blowing teams out = more than 5 points

371915020_378251800748367872 x	Should I put #Boldin on the bench in favor of #Garcon? @49ers sucked vs @Seahawks last year and @packers got lit last week @Harrison_NFL

371915020_370558283985059841 x	@SportsDocuments @DustinMRogers @TheePcue @Michael_Oram Bleacher report says Goodell made ~$30 mill in 2011 http://t.co/PSZaufS2OW
371915020_370622180079312896 x	@DustinMRogers @SportsDocuments @TheePcue @Michael_Oram but from what I found he has earned similar bonuses each year. Base up 3x from 2011
371915020_370625167124221952 x	@DustinMRogers @SportsDocuments @TheePcue @Michael_Oram Revenue way higher in NFL, hence the now $10 mill base and higher bonuses?
371915020_370630618226249728 x	@Michael_Oram @DustinMRogers @SportsDocuments @TheePcue Also has more players and significantly higher salaries to pay
