118729072_320643695433117696 x	Head over to @tBGLive for coverage.
118729072_318534237823307776 x	For the late night crowd: http://t.co/kpc4AgLI9a Our @BrotherlyGame FIFA 2013 (Xbox360) league. First come, first served. #mls #doop
118729072_318546658910687233 x	@c_j_henderson The reason why I don't is because I don't have a PS3.
118729072_202079657938534400 x	@c_j_henderson No idea
118729072_202048266790121473 x	Update on Mwanga #rumor: Was told that it's going 'round the Union facilities. Will continue to update as anything new comes along.
118729072_202050452827807745 x	@c_j_henderson As of right now, Califf to Chivas USA is 100% happening, Mwanga #rumor for a different team.
118729072_202052092385427456 x	@c_j_henderson I have no clue what the return is to be.
118729072_170576454432731136 x	High ticket prices too. $40 cheap seats. RT @RudiSchuller: @brotherlygame Wait, they're announcing a friendly NOW for the end of February?
118729072_169895329959919619 x	@c_j_henderson Did you check your spam?
118729072_169896208125526016 x	@c_j_henderson Do you have a secondary email to attempt it with? You can always change emails after activation.
118729072_169899066543718400 x	@c_j_henderson You can change it so that it's not linked to SBN once you've activated the account, so no worries there.
118729072_169901099262816256 x	@c_j_henderson You're welcome. What service is your original email from that didn't work? Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail...?
118729072_169901956146532354 x	@c_j_henderson Hm. Odd, yes. I'll pass it along.
118729072_169902738153541632 x	@c_j_henderson At the moment, it won't. Some work to do in terms of marketing and other things.
118729072_169904135846625282 x	@c_j_henderson The argument against soccer needs to end. Just accept a Philadelphia sports team and get over it. That's what I'd say to him.

118729072_164218113477443584 x	Le Toux has accounted for 45 (25 goals, 20 assists) of the Union's 79 goals all-time. That's 57% of the total offense.
118729072_164013108526985217 x	"From here on our I an not going to read anymore articles and just be surprised who we have the first game." lol

118729072_157549309984915456 x	Union take RAYMON GADDIS! Best right back in this draft.
118729072_157554431448195072 x	@TRE_Mukai "Right back"
118729072_157555880928362496 x	@TRE_Mukai No he's not. He's just like Sheanon Williams and what's the point of moving him left with Garfan and Lopez?
118729072_157551739661328386 x	@thegoalkeeper Mind if I use that pic?
118729072_157553468385665024 x	@c_j_henderson Some didn't play well enough in the combine, others just too questionable. Look at the Supplemental Draft for them to go.
118729072_157518695164424193 x	Defenders left on the board that I rate well: CBs - Hedges, Mayer; LBs: Estridge, Polak.
118729072_157458047076274177 x	On the docket: dispelling the Mwanga training laziness rumors, three pre-draft target lists, other goodies.
118729072_157309676088852482 x	@c_j_henderson Yeah, drafting an international makes no sense. I think Dwyer might have a green card.
118729072_157311997598380033 x	@c_j_henderson Like I said before, historically Mwanga would be the worst trade value ever if the return was an int'l slot.
118729072_142307816244391937 x	@c_j_henderson Looks like Martinez. No news on a LB.
118729072_341988852480761856 x	Yes. RT @BeastMode15432: @BrotherlyGame do you think there will be any new signings?
