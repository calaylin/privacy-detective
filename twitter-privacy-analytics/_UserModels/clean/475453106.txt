475453106_395186336891949057 x	@McCueJoseph @mccue_dawn you'd both be bagging groceries not making millions if you committed similar crimes. Facts on what he did accurate
475453106_395186081458839552 x	@McCueJoseph @mccue_dawn if he played for NY you'd want him burned at stake. Love convenient morality
475453106_395169955135909888 x	@howardeskin don't you think it makes sense to play Barkley and see what you have? Not sold on Foles...looks skittish at times.
475453106_393002016441913344 x	@mccue_dawn @MikeVick I respect soldiers more than professional athletes...so to you respect no one more than Vick is pretty absurd.
