91243226_399573467869106178 x	@CSNPhilly @tpanotchCSN Great to see Fred Shero was finally inducted after all of those years being left out.
91243226_399572992503447552 x	@NHL @28CGiroux Nice to see Claude break his scoring drought. Hope he is able to get back his scoring touch.
91243226_399572628257521666 x	@CoconnellFox29 I like that shot there.
91243226_399572476948008960 x	@TonyDungy @OfficialSoop92 @steelers That is surprising to me.
91243226_399572275579457536 x	@Jeff_McLane Certainly alot of history and tradition there.
91243226_397767421635092480 x	@FoxNews Because he knows it could bring.down his administration. His lack of action in saving those Americans was inexcusable.
91243226_397765153267392512 x	@Espngreeny This situation in Miami with the Dolphins is getting uglier by the moment.

91243226_10071343530 x	@acevu Got that right. Absolutely pathetic.
91243226_395554427236782080 x	@CSNPhilly The whole 2000-2001 season where he put the team on his back and got the Sixers to the NBA finals.
91243226_395520222796738560 x	@nufced I must say that I enjoy listening to Marc Zumoff announce the Sixers games.Very colorful.
91243226_395519691869155329 x	@FOX29philly I went out trick or treating up until the age of 13. After that I stopped.
91243226_395338415698640896 x	@BroadStBull A great charity that has done so much for a good cause.
91243226_395337625890205696 x	@PatGallen_975 I love listening to Sir Charles Barkley because he says what is on his mind.
91243226_395336799381651456 x	@NovaAthletics Rakim was great tonight.
91243226_395334851286798336 x	@Cindy610 Seems like yesterday that the Phillies were World Series Champs.
91243226_395172764644286464 x	@DanWetzel You can bet Penn State will remember that beatdown from Ohio State next year when Ohio State has to come to Happy Valley.
91243226_394987324289056768 x	@Hartsy19 This city is great.
91243226_394831162306478080 x	@FOX29philly You should definitely not put paper towels or feminine products in toilet. Not good at all.
91243226_394233190673821697 x	@imPULSEivity I was impressed with Jason Hart too.
91243226_394605874284888064 x	@novanation11 Sorry about that. I guess I got his name mixed up with the one who played at Syracuse back in the late 90's.
91243226_394234768499699713 x	@DTimmeneyFox29 I love the Good Day show in the morning Dawn.

91243226_393554269947052032 x	@KennethMoton People sure are getting into the Christmas season earlier.
91243226_393553518696873984 x	@NHLFlyers They needed this one. Nice that it was the Rangers.
91243226_393553221962432512 x	@AdamZagoria They are behind the times.
91243226_393552960229494784 x	@FOX29philly Finally!

91243226_390267307966332928 x	@NHLFlyers I am with you Angelo.
91243226_390267002839138304 x	@acevu I like the move Ace.
91243226_390266490517463041 x	@SpikeEskin Wow. Andrew Bynum is actually going to play a game. I can't believe it.
91243226_390266113105620992 x	@VUCoachJWright Sounds like it was a great event there Jay.
91243226_390265703028490240 x	@AshleyHoward17 I'll second that.
91243226_390265002466480128 x	@phillysport Always good thoughts from Bernie.
91243226_389405265759440896 x	@Coach_Talley @acevu Nice job by the Cats Coach Talley.
91243226_387956263679963136 x	@FoxNews Insane.That mother needs to be locked up for a long time.
91243226_387955760279597056 x	@975TheFanatic Against with Mike Golic. Mike Vick needs to do what he does best for Eagles to win.
91243226_387955087420964864 x	@DickieV You have to give the Red Sox credit for the way they bounced back from last year's bad season. They are playing well.
91243226_387903355328413696 x	@Bernieparent Great thoughts there Bernie.
91243226_387903135119077377 x	@KeeleyFox29 Such a sad reflection on the way our society has is today.
91243226_387179217030754304 x	@6abc Very sad.
91243226_387179043692761088 x	@KeithJones Cats were clutch at the end. Need to play well next week at Towson.
91243226_384690671162257408 x	@36westbrook Very true Brian.
91243226_384690084320395265 x	@phillysport @magelb Not surprising at all. There will probably be some more changes as well considering the way the season ended.
91243226_381839329687257088 x	@Yankees You are a class act Mo.
91243226_381838993102733312 x	@TheSeanDon Hope you are enjoying your day there Sean.
91243226_381838653829681152 x	@PhillyPhillies I like the move by the Phillies in keeping Ryne Sandberg as manager.
91243226_380696311961780224 x	@CasualHoya I agree. Good to see the new Big East schools do well recruiting wise.
91243226_380695672095518720 x	@VUhoops Cats need to come up big on Saturday.
91243226_380695249250947072 x	@SenJohnMcCain United States needs to stay out of Syria. Very bad situation.
91243226_380470140259008512 x	@The700Level Roy Halliday had some good years here in Philadelphia but it is time for him to move on.
91243226_380332109216624640 x	@TheSeanDon Absolutely Sean. Billy Lange does a great job on Jay Wright's staff and is a great asset.
91243226_380116619718307840 x	@alvenella Nice to see.the support Allison.
91243226_379961926744547328 x	@ESPNStatsInfo Cliff Lee has been one of the few bright spots on this year's Phillies team. Great performance last night.

91243226_379767876821209088 x	@VUhoops Let's hope the Cats get first win of the year.
91243226_379351373953105920 x	@KacieFOX29 Eagles should have had this one. Gotta get Kansas City Thursday.
91243226_379350972952498177 x	@JeffSkversky Defense has to improve period.
91243226_379350775916670976 x	@Coach_Talley Wonderful news Coach Talley. Your charity certainly has made a difference in the lives of others. Keep up the good work.
91243226_379346084596031489 x	@CBSSports I like Denver in this one.
91243226_379345814285717505 x	@sheridanmj4 Good to hear Mike.
91243226_379021327195443200 x	@Brian_Ewart I agree Brian. Villanova needs to beat Stony Brook next week and get that first win of the year.
91243226_379004115898343424 x	@phillysport I listened to last week's game with Villanova and Fordham is good. Temple should have won but Fordham is no pushover.
91243226_379002742955835393 x	@SportsRadioWIP I listened to the Villanova-Fordham game last week and Fordham is no joke. They have a good team.
91243226_378118701503221760 x	@KacieFOX29 Let's go Flyers and get back into the playoffs this year.
91243226_378118295192633344 x	@FOX29philly I cannot wait for the Flyers to start back. Hopefully they will be back in the playoffs this year.
91243226_378117816547016704 x	@SethDavisHoops I agree Seth. Something needs to be done about this issue.
91243226_376831513356414976 x	@Bernieparent I cannot wait for the Eagles to start tomorrow. I like Denver and San Francisco as my Super Bowl pick.
91243226_375671792587014144 x	@CBSSports If Andrew Bynum ever returns.
91243226_375670633595957249 x	@FoxNews After all that Anthony Weiner has done he should expect the treatment he got.
91243226_375590302406701057 x	@ESPNAndyKatz I like Nova-Gtown matchup at end of year.
91243226_375220055715618816 x	@kurt13warner I have no argument with your list there Kurt.
91243226_375219507306172416 x	@JSalisburyCSN Phillies have seen better days.
91243226_374630228154654720 x	@VUhoops Shame to hear about Pat Haggerty.
91243226_374629089208188928 x	@975TheFanatic You can bet the fans would be very unhappy.
91243226_374628827450077185 x	@VUhoops Nice to see Ben land somewhere.
91243226_374277024300691456 x	@JeffSkversky Whatever can go wrong with the Phillies this year has.
91243226_374275722158014464 x	@sjnard Villanova played very well. Cats will be strong in CAA this year.
91243226_374239525708386304 x	@PatGallen_975 The NCAA is a total joke.
91243226_374238550285234176 x	@JayGlazer @ProFootballTalk I think Mike McGloin if he plays like he did at Penn State that the Raiders could have gotten a steal with him.
91243226_374172918718025728 x	@VUCoachJWright My thoughts and prayers are with her family and loved ones at this sad time.
91243226_374171501731119104 x	@VillanovaFH @UNCFieldHockey Go Cats!
91243226_374171209392345088 x	@975TheFanatic I was not getting my hopes up from the start. I say the Eagles will probably be 6-10 this season but will be interesting.
91243226_374170494980726784 x	@Myarou13 Best wishes Mouph in your new endeavors.
91243226_374170126242689025 x	@howardeskin Phillies need to go with younger players. Michael Young is getting near the end of the road anyways.
91243226_374169522388746241 x	@phillysport @LesBowen Not having started to play football until he was 22,Danny Watkins clearly was a reach as a first round pick.
91243226_373985796606283776 x	@Jeff_McLane I thought the pick of Danny Watkins was a reach to begin with being that he did not play football that long.
91243226_373445925391581184 x	@VillanovaCheer Go Cats.
91243226_373445503503314944 x	@GeorgetownHoops Way to go attacking the Exorcist steps.

91243226_372715063146459136 x	@jillianbmele I am a proud graduate of Conestoga High School. How about those Pioneers.
91243226_372693506307162112 x	@975TheFanatic I think they should keep Nick Foles incase something happens to Mike Vick.
91243226_372691547864965120 x	@FoxNews Good to see the NYPD take the initiative against the terrorists.
91243226_372691113779691520 x	@KacieFOX29 Very touching photo there.

91243226_372039281503895552 x	@Brian_Ewart I have a good feeling about Saturday's game. Would not be surprised if Cats won.
91243226_372038688353841152 x	@sheridanmj4 Looking forward to the season Mike.
91243226_371980520131158016 x	@howardeskin I agree. Like the new approach from Chip Kelly.

91243226_83909298182303744 x	@VUCoachJWright @Coach_Chambers Very glad for Keith Urgo as well.
91243226_21243148931960834 x	@VUhoops Same to you.
91243226_21204099176 x	@PhillyPhillies nice gem by Roy tonight.
91243226_11960056161 x	@MTHTrainsLike this new club car.
91243226_11960010254 x	@ThePhillies I'm liking this team alot. Offense going to be great this season.
91243226_10071449031 x	@DickieV Those things happen occassionally. They will not be down for long though.
91243226_10071361135 x	@ThePhillies Good to see Cole Hamels with good outing.
91243226_10071310089 x	@TheSeanDon Can't wait. It will be nice to see guys from 85 championship team.
91243226_8427145964 x	@DickieV I think they watched how Villanova beat them in last year's NCAA's.
91243226_8427123178 x	@georgetownhoyas I'll bet Coach thompson looked at highlights of Villanova's win over Duke in last year's NCAA's.
91243226_8427078066 x	@georgetownhoyas Hoyas reall beat Duke all over the court on the offensive and defensive end of the floor.
91243226_7422773059 x	@georgetownhoyas Chris Wright was strong in the Hoys win over St.John's. One of the better guards in Big east.
91243226_7422722928 x	@MLB Great career. Randy Johnson one of the best I ever saw.
91243226_7422698383 x	@Sixers He deserves it. I cannot fathom the Cowboys being America's team.
91243226_7337648516 x	@TheSeanDon Scottie absolutely clutch.
91243226_7337627601 x	@dgoneil1 Kansas too deep for Temple. May very well be National Champs.
91243226_7337599678 x	@GoldBlueWVU Not this year. They have not played well enough to get back to playoffs.
91243226_7337539374 x	@NFLONFOX Think Tom Brady is player of decade too.
91243226_7337526497 x	@MLB Think Tim Raines should be in the Hall of Fame and Andre Dawson and Bert Blyleven should definitely be in.
91243226_7243314812 x	@DickieV I'm sure it's tough anytime you go from a winning program like the Tar heels to an NBA team that is going through tough times.
91243226_7243250275 x	@ESPN_CollHoops I'll be watching. especially the GTown-St.John's game.Love the Big east.
91243226_7243201597 x	@DickieV i'll second that.
91243226_7243180152 x	@Coach_Chambers Good  luck Pat.
91243226_7114271041 x	@dgoneil1 People need to take a look at the likes of Dean Smith,John Thompson and Bob Knight to see that you should get out with class.
91243226_7114208902 x	@dgoneil1 I absolutely agree Dana.
91243226_7096049827 x	@VUhoops I think Villanova has to at least consider making the move.
91243226_7033420920 x	@cvuocolo I can understand that.
91243226_7002782592 x	@Yankee_Fan_09 Although I am a Phillies fan I do like the Yankees. I do not like the Mets though.
91243226_6835424353 x	Nice job by the Villanova Football team in winning the National Championship last night. Chris Whitney and Matt Sczur awesome.
91243226_6747451996 x	@DickieV Was at that game and as Nova fan I can say Temple deserved to win. They played better. Cats will be fine though.
91243226_6369768836 x	@VUhoops Great pickup by the Cats. Cats will be NCAA champs very soon.
91243226_6254478880 x	@dgoneil1 I think Yarou should sit out till 100 percent healthy. Nova doing the right thing.
