541321883_386907420707930112 x	The FLAGS are pink? LMAO
541321883_384452477837266944 x	@Bougie_Unbound Yeah. that "Andy Drafted" defense. good players (except at S) playing out of their natural order
541321883_382096665911386112 x	@Bougie_Unbound The Concept Coupe? Yeah. I think it'll have more of a '14 S60 end if ever produced but it's definitely a good look.
541321883_382155271935885312 x	@Bougie_Unbound It does have an ancestor: the original "un-Volvo", the P1800.
541321883_382307034634285056 x	@Bougie_Unbound it's also the same model that Irv Gordon famously just clocked 3 million miles on the original engine this year.
