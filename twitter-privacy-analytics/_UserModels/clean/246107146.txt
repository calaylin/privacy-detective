246107146_392730980580331520 x	@SpikeEskin oh hey, I wanted to ask you something. Do you think the #Sixers are saying Noel out 4 season to not repeat Bynum situation?
246107146_392684532643954688 x	@GoPhillyFlyers I don't think they will. But I hope I'm wrong, and they can turn it around. The team just looks lost.
246107146_423170655157510145 x	@Rowie_Hoseman @Expo_Nizzo I was a Foles doubter until after the Cards game. He's passed every test. No QB went down the field more last yr
246107146_423171344755605504 x	@TheZompster @Rowie_Hoseman @Expo_Nizzo Yeah, well he also left some points on the field too. But that's what you get w/a young team, right?
246107146_423172645539282944 x	@TheZompster He also made a few bad reads, on the option play. But I don't see how ppl aren't satisfied to this point.
246107146_423174020104998912 x	@TheZompster that's why I don't understand ppl when they say it was a "lost opportunity." They coulda won that game, but weren't winning SB
246107146_423174625938640896 x	@TheZompster I agree. Need a good draft, and have to add a couple pieces in free agency. They can't take a step back.
