972085056_395752235637800960 x	@Winless4Mariota @rickseagles @davespadaro Good thing you two aren't running the franchise with this "tanking is good' approach to the game.
972085056_395753249275260928 x	@Winless4Mariota @rickseagles @davespadaro  This might be an outrageous idea. How about we let our team play the games out?
972085056_395754435525107712 x	@Winless4Mariota @rickseagles @davespadaro Team is one game back in the division and you want to give it all up? Future promises nothing.
972085056_395756368704966657 x	@Winless4Mariota @rickseagles @davespadaro Exactly the division is the worst. The mentality should be enter the dance and see what happens.
972085056_395755798845878272 x	@rickseagles @Winless4Mariota You two must be the kind of people, when you were younger participated in tee ball and didn't keep score.
