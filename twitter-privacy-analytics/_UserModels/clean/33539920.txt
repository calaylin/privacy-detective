33539920_388737055695835136 x	And then he wonders why people talk shit about Philly fans.
33539920_388743878121377793 x	@ndevalex i tweeted it
33539920_388643242096726016 x	This chick looks just like Morris Chestnut.
33539920_388645837683040256 x	@ndevalex lmao I'm still bad Ricky got killed.
33539920_386302800293945345 x	He was safe!!!

33539920_380479491652321280 x	Asche is really good at 3rd base.
33539920_378985589481041922 x	How the hell is that cause for an ejection?
33539920_378986845326958592 x	.@DMJ365 I was watching the replay, it wasn't targeting.  You always seem to think you gotta explain sports to me.
33539920_395597770427727872 x	How the hell was Iverson overrated Ingy?
33539920_389474421770948609 x	This poor defense is probably like, "You got to be fucking kidding me. We gotta go back out on the field already?"
33539920_389465435457867776 x	Why are they giving these receivers so much space!!!
33539920_389437168927535104 x	@bomck23 I wish he'd get comfortable on another team.
33539920_389197577880494080 x	WE WON!!!!!!!!
33539920_389187967488499713 x	@bomck23 They got me on pins and needles here.
33539920_386948799920214019 x	I'm about to cry.  We're gonna win a game.
33539920_386928587439235072 x	HAHAHAHA They lost 2 timeouts!!!
33539920_386920527886966784 x	@bomck23 You might wanna go get some more alcohol at halftime.
33539920_386922651807019009 x	@bomck23 Nope, he can do it.  Were you at training camp at the Linc?
33539920_386922411007803392 x	@bomck23 Well he might have to for the rest of the game.  I'm cool with that though.  We need Mike healthy.
33539920_386917368330330112 x	So it's cool for the Giants fans to cheer Mike coming up gimpy.
33539920_386906220663037952 x	He did not get the T.O. in time!  Bullshit
33539920_386908301830537217 x	@bomck23 And that's not happening lately.  Maybe if these receivers hold onto a damn ball.
33539920_386908876638916608 x	@bomck23 I've been frustrated.  I need alcohol. lol
33539920_389024587352403968 x	@ProFootballTalk @cjamesPhilly That means he'll be traded soon.
33539920_396410417016098817 x	Your first place 76ers about to hit the floor.

33539920_378951302803247104 x	@conshydane I'm guessing it's when I responded to his pic of him in the cowboy's jersey.  I said, "the hell is this?"
33539920_378911161590099968 x	Here goes Corso. lol
33539920_396433881806962688 x	So my daughter saw this pic and said, who's the Asian guy? I said, me. http://t.co/3bceEPEayb
