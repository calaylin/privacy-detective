1323351062_399981769187143680 x	@Mmarich15 But just for this week Foles definitely should start again. You can't go back to Vick after Foles has been great recently.
1323351062_399982957487980544 x	@Mmarich15 But like you said if Foles plays like he did against Dallas again this week then if Vick is healthy they could go back to him.
1323351062_399984133658902528 x	@Mmarich15 Yeah I agree with that. I hope Chip does that but I'm just hoping Foles plays great again this week.
1323351062_399984986440601601 x	@Mmarich15 You don't need a run-oriented QB to be a great team. If Foles plays like this for the rest of the season now, I see him starting
1323351062_400034925350383616 x	@Mmarich15 Agreed, he can run at times which is good also and is accurate throwing. Foles is the guy 100% right now
1323351062_400035775372218368 x	@Mmarich15 But say Foles struggles for the rest of the season, would you draft a QB then? Vick shouldn't start next season.
1323351062_400038395743059969 x	@Mmarich15 He's done here and that is the truth. I don't know about Mariota though or Manziel. I'd take Bridgewater over them both
1323351062_400039613290389504 x	@Mmarich15 Honestly I haven't seen a lot of Bridgewater and Mariota may be shaky in the NFL. That game vs Stanford I saw he was shaky
1323351062_400041334519906304 x	@Mmarich15 That's tough but if Foles starts to struggle this season then maybe. What team would offer that to us? The first overall pick?
1323351062_400042567037108225 x	@Mmarich15 If that first pick they offer us gets us the right guy then I would let that happen.

1323351062_400044690420301824 x	@Mmarich15 I knew from the start Luck would be better. Luck is just a better all around QB and the Colts are lucky to have him for a while.
