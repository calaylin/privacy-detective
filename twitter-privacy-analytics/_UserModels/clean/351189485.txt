351189485_394560699604545536 x	Funny when Brady cries like a baby bitching at his coaches and receivers people love it, but Bryant's a punk.
351189485_394570118195204097 x	@NickHarring That's such ridiculous reasoning. Brady always blames everyone else and bitched at his OC for INT in the end zone two years ago
351189485_394571098689265664 x	@NickHarring Funny thing is Brady hasn't won shit in 9 years and hasn't won anything since he defense bailed him out
