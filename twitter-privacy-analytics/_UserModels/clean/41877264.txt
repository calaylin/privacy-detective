41877264_289205459666219008 x	Kind of upset they don't have Community. I really want to get into it!
41877264_288705968735391744 x	@danielrquinn @ogol_costellosp I'd be surprised if the Flyers used a year of his contract right after being drafted. 9 game tryout, correct?
41877264_220558679689273344 x	@danielrquinn Couldn't agree more. Penguins essentially worse without J. Staal, Devils with a huge void, no Parise for either of them.

41877264_161894642747580416 x	@danielrquinn Harts is on a better team. +/- is a meaningless stat. Hartnell deserves to be there, but I think others should be there.

41877264_136880585430933504 x	@ErikRinehold No, I know. Crosby shouldn't be on the ballot. Just because he's the face of the NHL, he is. #stupid #pissed
