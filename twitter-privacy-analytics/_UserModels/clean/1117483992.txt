1117483992_358341599614353408 x	@magelb So we lost one guy who was effective 2/3 of the time... Maybe Jose Mesa can still pitch?
1117483992_357619551304818688 x	@quasimado Thank you! The story is really interesting and well done. Hardly a fluff piece or sympathetic.

1117483992_357000685625151488 x	@brianros1 @RoobCSN @derrick3DPhilly @heshyshmu Yes to Rios. Asche is a nice prospect, Rios is an allstar. Not difficult, not happening.
1117483992_357000145155530752 x	@magelb Giles likes "sex appeal" in players like Utley? Odd choice of words from an old guy or insight into organizational strategy?
1117483992_356994418672287744 x	@RoobCSN @heshyshmu Yes in a second. A minor leaguer for a borderline all-star? Are thou nuts? Galvis, Hernandez, FA, etc can play 3b.
