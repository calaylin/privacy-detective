61875868_394964833499484160 x	With JRich, Noel, + Moultrie going to be inactive for a while, will be interesting if #sixers petition league to allow 16 players on roster
61875868_395656656089907200 x	Andrew Bynum is going to play in 70 games this season, just to spite me.
61875868_398248234017374208 x	@ChrisVito I actually like upper bowl.  Easier to see plays develop.  Plus, in just a little bit farther from miss it, miss it, miss it.
61875868_400076539967991808 x	So uh, was today the last time in the 2013-14 season the #sixers will be over .500 ?
61875868_395947478102470656 x	@KyleNeubeck @rich_hofmann haha.  I'm just playing.  I don't really care.

61875868_395898318640795648 x	I hope people maintain realistic expectations for Michael Carter-Williams after last nights game.
61875868_395900980073484289 x	@KyleNeubeck Eh, in 3 weeks the audience will be so small I'm not sure it matters all that much, to be honest.
61875868_395901333015760896 x	@KyleNeubeck That is probably true.
61875868_395633190305402880 x	Glad @EliotShorrParks asked that question.  That bit about Aaron McKie stole the show.
61875868_393852345588518912 x	#sixers need to find a way to unload 2 of their 6 legitimate NBA players quickly to keep pace.
