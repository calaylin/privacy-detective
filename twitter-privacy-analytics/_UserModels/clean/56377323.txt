56377323_322930944208162816 x	I asked someone that recently and was told Lindy Ruff's tough style is too close to Lavy's. RT @taweetthis: Lindy a fit?
56377323_322931962966847490 x	@aboyle7211 That's just what I was told about Ruff. Don't know if it's true or not.
56377323_322933648821215232 x	@aboyle7211 Lavy is proven winner. He won a Cup, took Flyers to Final. Knowing how impatient Flyers are, it'll be tough for Lavy to stay
56377323_322934952209571841 x	@aboyle7211 Big decision will be on Bryz.. Will Flyers buy him out or not? I'm hearing Snider wants to keep him.
56377323_319182744502558720 x	I hear you, but Jagr brings so much fans don't see. RT @aboyle7211: if Giroux needs a 40 yr old to play his best, flyers are in trouble
56377323_319176566733164544 x	Everyone disappeared against NJ. You're blaming Jagr? RT @JA_9009: @RandyJMiller What explains disappearing act at end of last season?
56377323_316731557845020672 x	Bundy not happy with Bryz allowing Nash to score Rangers 4th goal on wraparound. "This goal just can't happen."

56377323_312017102129225728 x	Flyers losing 5-1 in 3rd & it's a shooting gallery in their end. Team looks like it quit, and when that happens, coaches often get blame.
56377323_311994707578343425 x	Lavy standing behind #Flyers bench with arms crossed looking bewildered.
56377323_311990047962460160 x	Jake scores to tie game ... then Bryz screws up and lets in easy one.
56377323_310460762533531650 x	Bryz had a vey good stretch to start season, but has had issues of late. Even before today, his save percentage was below .900 for 1st time
56377323_349579610704449537 x	I am very certain Bryz did not want to stay in Philly due to coach, his system, booing fans, tough media.
56377323_312002315408244737 x	Not much said about this guy ... but Coburn really struggling this season. Devils just made him look bad taking 4-1 lead.
56377323_186507556749975554 x	#Flyers definitely have taken crowd out of game by scoring late in first and early in 2nd to tie game. #veryquiet

56377323_312010659128823808 x	I see big changes coming soon for #Flyers, who don't give up on seasons. Will it be trade or firing? I think we'll know by next week.
56377323_311639051667116032 x	U smoking funny stuff legally in Colo., or illegally elsewhere? RT @xkj1985x: Malkin vanishes at times. Give Shelley shot and he'll explode.
56377323_220578040776884225 x	#Flyers lose out on Parise, Suter. What's next? http://t.co/y5aw4nnY
56377323_219850650811506688 x	If you're Anaheim GM Bob Murray, do u prefer a package for Bobby Ryan starting with #Sabres Derek Roy or #Flyers Matt Read? I'm taking Read.

56377323_351431544893734912 x	Dallas on clock at No. 10, then #Flyers go at 11. Flyers now guaranteed, if they want, to get eitherD Ryan Pulock or D Nikita Zadorov
