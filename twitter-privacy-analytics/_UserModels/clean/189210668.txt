189210668_394637208696549377 x	@TheePcue you? Also JT now had a new BFF so it doesn't matter!
189210668_393926291822354432 x	@TheePcue yeah now have him do it against good players! Also why do you always delete the name of person you are retweeting!? Just annoying
189210668_393933258271911936 x	@TheePcue I'm sure you can figure it out! From now on, no name and I assume you are making it up! Lol

189210668_382295733497384960 x	@TheePcue but Clarkson was automatic and therefore no intrigue knew he gets 10, not a Shannaban but a rule book ban. & no1 cares about Weiss
189210668_382299267760537600 x	@TheePcue not rude, factual!
189210668_370628960939307009 x	@KDotThompson @DustinMRogers @SportsDocuments @TheePcue the NFL is a $9B industry so yeah revenue stream just a touch higher!
