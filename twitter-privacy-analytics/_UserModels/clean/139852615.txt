139852615_396005548140670976 x	@azluticky @davespadaro @Winless4Mariota It's all about value. Teddy at 1, Mariota at 2 or a guy like Stephen Morris at 40. What best value?
139852615_396026116499992576 x	@Winless4Mariota @azluticky @davespadaro Much. much better passer though. Size is even if he isn't bigger.
139852615_395739332721385472 x	@davespadaro @Winless4Mariota We already have a running QB with a skinny frame that can't stay healthy. Do we need another?
139852615_395740760911269889 x	@Winless4Mariota @davespadaro Vick is 6'0, 210. More bulk on his frame.I'm just saying running QBs in NFL are 225+ or they don't last.
