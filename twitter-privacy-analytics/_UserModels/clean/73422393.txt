73422393_279589379947782144 x	@WIPMorningShow beasley just embarrassed himself w/ that opening statement. Don't expect him to bury Reid, but he just lost credibility.
73422393_277171385456029698 x	@Bighugh53 ...cuz as weak as Hartford is, ain't nothin' else around #hartfordlifesucks
73422393_270308811049410562 x	@DennisDeitch that made me laugh. Imagining slow mo, opera, dumb fat guys getting pelted, popcorn everywhere

73422393_277051283972689920 x	@WIPMorningShow still funny, of course. Just not out of the blue...
73422393_277051152342867968 x	@WIPMorningShow didn't the announcer say that because Kobe told gasol to "put on your big boy pants" ? Don't think the guy came up with it.

73422393_276075231376977920 x	@DennisDeitch I'm despondent over Pagan but agree he wanted to go SF after WS win. Now I want Morse .Thoughts? Overrated but still...
73422393_276076723706138625 x	@DennisDeitch so we're f'd. I can't get excited about Bourne, especially overpaying. Don't believe in Ruf as everyday (yet).Fowler is foul.
73422393_275982159561490432 x	@ryanlawrence21 Any chance Phils will go after Morse? Do you think he'd be a good signing for LF? Like the power, RH.
