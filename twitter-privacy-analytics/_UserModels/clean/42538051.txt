42538051_392056284780199936 x	@suburbsokrates the Redskins are 7-0 right? Stupid argument to make. Loss is a loss win is a win.
42538051_392052260349673472 x	RT @973espn: Did the #Eagles come up small?  Defense played well, kept them in the game Nick Foles simply did not play well enough for them?
42538051_392052056976281600 x	#EaglesQB Foles should get another start to see if he can bounce back from a terrible game. If not then Vick should take over.
42538051_392046933768167424 x	Bad game by Nick Foles today. #eagles #growingpains

42538051_392019154624327680 x	Whelp, another game at home and what looks to be another loss. The streak continues. #eagles
42538051_392018513852125185 x	Well, I was happy to see Barkley but don't need to see him again. #eagles
42538051_392015627126599680 x	Boykin is garbage. How can you not cover Beasley. #eagles
42538051_392014738772996096 x	This must be that we give up defense #eagles
42538051_392014270848053248 x	Now we play horrible defense #eagles
42538051_392013730776903680 x	Here comes Barkley #eagles
42538051_392012647891472384 x	C'mon guys get the points before the quarter is over.
42538051_392012108793384960 x	You have to go for that. #eagles
42538051_392011591157571584 x	That ball may have skimmed the ground but it should not have been this close. #eagles
42538051_392010851085205504 x	This is unbelievable #eagles
42538051_392010502077169664 x	@rm973 looked like it could be a nasty sprain. Hopefully not the Achilles tendon
42538051_392010233008369664 x	Now we might have to use the 3 TEs we have on the roster. #eagles

42538051_389484432207650817 x	@rm973 Vick apologists always come up with excuses. Point is Vick sucks as a QB. Always has and will continue.
42538051_389494439938646016 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 throw out the past like I'm going to, why should Vick start?
42538051_389497349758005249 x	@OsoLiveRadio I think that was proven wrong today.
42538051_389501153358381056 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 I can because he wasn't really doing anything against the Giants, who have a worse defense than the Bucs.
42538051_389502438497353730 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 the giants had all the momentum. Your the second person to argue that.
42538051_389503947540795392 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 everything. I guess it was Foles fault we surrendered the lead?
42538051_389505247003303936 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 where was I holding him accountable for our sucky D?
42538051_389507134905659392 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 you might want to go back and re-read what I posted because I didn't say anything about that. Giants having the (1/2)

42538051_389508852305375233 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 the Bucs do have a better defense than the Giants bro. Are you avoiding facts/stats?
42538051_389510237298102274 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 are we talking about defense or QBs now?
42538051_389511570642173953 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 I bow down to your all mystic psychic powers and ability to be able to predict outcomes of games. Hail the almighty.
42538051_389508064388599809 x	@OsoLiveRadio @rm973 is it Foles fault we were playing a rookie QB. Are you trying to use that as an argument?
