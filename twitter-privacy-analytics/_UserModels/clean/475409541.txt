475409541_386222030573416448 x	?@HockeysFuture: @DustinMRogers @Michael_Oram Not tease, it's up now.? Fantastic! Big fan of Galchenyuk, glad to see him on top.
475409541_386341847565484033 x	@TheePcue @Michael_Oram I have Galch and three others in the top 50. @HockeysFuture Any reason why Olli Maatta didn't make the top 50?
475409541_375125395722338305 x	Is Corey Crawford really worth a six-year, $36 million contract? @michael_oram @TheePcue @jpinkster87 http://t.co/7SV4pkkx7X
475409541_370378121263845376 x	@TheePcue @SportsDocuments @KDotThompson @Michael_Oram For that matter, I'd like to see what bud selig and other comm's make? #NHL
475409541_370579622875758592 x	@KDotThompson @SportsDocuments @TheePcue @Michael_Oram Take away the massive bonus and he made about the same as Bettman. #nhl
475409541_370623480972075009 x	@KDotThompson @SportsDocuments @TheePcue @Michael_Oram that's very interesting then. Revenue streams are off the chart compared to #NHL no?
