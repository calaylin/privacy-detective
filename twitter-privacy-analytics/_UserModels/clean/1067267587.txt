1067267587_392750121328193536 x	@PhilthyBrass @PhillyFan  Giroux $66.2 million Hartnell $28.5 million Streit $ 21 million  Voracek $17 million  Read $14.5 million
1067267587_392751426583023617 x	@PhilthyBrass @PhillyFan  Yeah.  And our defensemen are all old and overpaid or injury prone - what team would want Meszaros?
1067267587_392752307797897217 x	@PhilthyBrass A lot of guys liked Carle becuase he skates well...But he wasn't physical at all and turned over the puck a lot....
1067267587_392753505628196864 x	@PhilthyBrass The way I see it you need tough, physical defensemen to win in the playoffs....
