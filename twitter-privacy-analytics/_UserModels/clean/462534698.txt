462534698_391025314853580800 x	Philly , Jersey , Capitals not looking very good . Need to win 7 out of the next 10 games
462534698_391015043737079809 x	@CunningStunts3 5 and 22 not good right now
462534698_390287780053786624 x	You have to take stick and body - That is a teaching point for Flyers D
462534698_390295856265842688 x	@CunningStunts3 the most dangerous guy is front ( needs to be covered ) of the net - the player behind the net can't score
462534698_390457391487401984 x	@CunningStunts3 flush him when you have help and the front protected
462534698_393365257051447296 x	Matter of fact those players are a major reason Bruins won a Cup and are a successful team - plus they have a really good coach
462534698_393382696300191744 x	@Al_DeLaurentis I watch for everything - high intensity game , hitting , speed , skill and passion.

462534698_390458196898631680 x	If there is ever a win you really need it's tomorrow against the Pens - Pens are rolling ,very confident team and want to bury the Flyers

462534698_330997236622299138 x	LA and Blues series is very intense and nasty. Nobody is turning away from an opportunity to finish a check.
462534698_352201430150561792 x	Wouldn't be surprised if Lecavalier signs with the Flyers

462534698_230874656909950976 x	August hockey questions ..does Crosby play 75 games and more ..do the Coyotes make the playoffs ....is Bryzgalov's save percentage over .912
462534698_396679635792318464 x	And there is plenty of blame to go around - can't stand finger pointers - look in the mirror and do your job !!!
462534698_387587374579867650 x	Winners go out and earn it while losers go out and talk about it !! Chief will make them earn it - enough talk
462534698_386689505002262528 x	@HornChris14 you are right. Bad body position

462534698_391316384044838912 x	@KristiJo74 @irishRie you should not feed them bottom line. My bad. Haha
462534698_395521508212101120 x	Gonna breakdown the Ducks 3rd goal against the Flyers during Friday's pre-game show . 3 costly mistakes late in game . Unacceptable
462534698_395365435069440000 x	I will be doing Fridays game against the struggling Caps . Another big game for both teams
462534698_395368516112887808 x	@rickybottalico not good bud - seems like 10 to 12 guys go south at the same time - you can get away with 2 or 3 but not 10 players
