38667566_395328681586855936 x	@McChief1961 I dunno. He had that chance in August.

38667566_394523124647342080 x	Eagles are trying to play hide-the-quarterback right now. Can't do that in the NFL. #EaglesTalk

38667566_98508081914322944 x	Waiting to hear Rob Ryan's comment on the Ronnie Brown signing
38667566_335839326745276416 x	RE: Avant. I heard his work on defense is nickel CB. Makes sense, since those are the guys who defend him. Again, experimental. Versatility.
38667566_306148407439925250 x	Mike Patterson, great guy, also released, Eagles confirm. Sad to see him go. Cedric Thornton looking like DE right now.
38667566_275446940823605248 x	It's really, really, really time to get David Sims into the game. Maybe even Curtis Marsh, too. #EaglesTalk
38667566_393783717631520768 x	Nick Foles is out vs. Giants, didn't practice today. Jake Knott also out. Look for #Eagles to sign GJ Kinne from practice squad.

38667566_377250769314910208 x	Test here to see if Kelly's offense can function when it's not uptempo. So far, a third-and-long.
38667566_377224250580819968 x	Peters out of the game, Barbre in at left tackle
38667566_395279316684009472 x	Forgot to mention rookie Damion Square. He should probably be active again, see more time.

38667566_361543345455104000 x	Stop me if you've heard this before: Vick hits Celek across the middle, but the ball bounced off celek's fingertips.
38667566_342705155948548096 x	A rare bomb in 7 on 7s. Foles hit Djax in the end zone for a 65-yard TD. All through the air.

38667566_386935784479420416 x	Can't fault Wolff too much. Randle makes an athletic catch  and Eli didn't see much pressure, had time for Randle to finish.  #EaglesTalk
38667566_380807991613591552 x	Vinny Curry will be active tonight for the #Eagles, I'm told.
38667566_379629469423529984 x	Chip says refs told him whistle blew play dead on Malcom Floyd drop. So even if he wanted to challenge, wouldn't have been able to.
38667566_388331119428784128 x	Vick hasn't done any full-speed sprinting yet. Did a little 7-on-7 yesterday.
