229229794_222701663843131392 x	@swampNDN Just curious as to why you retweet just about every one of your tweets.  Really want to follow you, but the amount of retweets....
229229794_220888219603050497 x	@LisaKellyIRT Welcome back. Miss seeing you on IRC. Why aren't you on there anymore?
229229794_220326754768793600 x	@CaptElliott So since you walked away are you basically fired now or what?
229229794_218769900565561345 x	@SwampPeople What was the episode name/number for this episode that just aired?  My @comcast menu never flagged the new episode last night.

229229794_218768831420694528 x	@CaptElliott I think you missed my point.  You said the boat driving through the ice was BS, but I'm telling you what I saw on the TV.
229229794_218425289888370688 x	@AllWaltrip You haven't seen anything yet. It's supposed to get hotter as the weekend continues.
