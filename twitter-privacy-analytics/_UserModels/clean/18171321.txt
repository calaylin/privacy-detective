18171321_391908377280143360 x	What are your predictions for Eagles/Cowboys? And why/how? We'll read the best ones off on @975TheFanatic during the show.
18171321_386969302068641792 x	Welker and Demaryius have no catches...and the Broncos are still up 4. Peyton laughs at those who would say his brother is better.
18171321_390984270564831232 x	Flyers still shootin blanks. Just can't finish.
18171321_395925590970499073 x	I think my fave MCW play from last night was grabbing a major board over the weak Chris Bosh with under 30 seconds left. So great.
18171321_359425987903111169 x	Cubs got 4 players from Rangers for Matt Garza? Really? What would the Phillies have gotten for Lee?
18171321_325662417939988480 x	I'm missing the Red Sox opening ceremony. Hoping I'll be able to watch it later on. It's gotta be an awesome moment at Fenway.
18171321_386609588474490880 x	Might be risky for Phillies, but trading Revere and signing Ellsbury would be a fun move.
18171321_386947052087025664 x	ELI!
18171321_342751421491462144 x	Michael Young batting lead off can only mean one thing. And I have no idea what that is.
18171321_341718993914191872 x	Dom's away...with a nasty bat flip. Awesome at-bat by Domonic Brown.
18171321_340271106697068544 x	Warnings just issues to both benches after Horst hits Ellsbury. Seemed like an innocuous HBP to me.
18171321_340271820454375424 x	@gregemkey I couldnt see the reaction from here. But if it was retaliation it was stupid because they need to win the game.
18171321_320269693451644928 x	4 batters in, Phils score first. Utley and Howard back to back ropes to RF. Quick start in front of the home crowd gets everyone jazzed.
18171321_225715766543130626 x	Who is this Hunter Pence you speak of?
18171321_369960964487380992 x	This is clown baseball, bro.
18171321_369961815947886592 x	@snibbs10 It's August 20th and the Phillies are 20 out. What's it matter? They're seeing what they have.
18171321_374843269219635200 x	Sorry, Not Lakewood for Franco. It was Clearwater!
18171321_374844908093591552 x	@brianstartare Not really the biggest deal. He went from A to AA and played well. End of story.
18171321_374973812015890433 x	@west6 It's something they'll talk about. But not much they can do.
18171321_276669882043604992 x	Should the Phillies: A. overpaid for Keppinger, B. trade for M. Young (platoon him), C. play Frandsen everyday. Don't say none of the above.
18171321_395327330987802624 x	Charles Barkley looks like Sir Charles of the late 80s. So thin. Good for him.
18171321_372808923830829057 x	Suspending Manziel for one half is an absolute embarrassment and the NCAA may as well disband. Suspend him or don't.
18171321_346765491622260737 x	The Phanatic's cart has stalled along the third baseline. He's helping to push it off the field. Everything breaking down here in Philly.
18171321_394271763577974784 x	Anyone buy Shreddies yet? The flatulence free underwear? Asking for a friend. And by friend I mean me.
18171321_387017857617625088 x	The Pittsburgh Pirate faithful should read this before they get too excited. Seriously. http://t.co/Hv77Wr4p2n
18171321_388133000107798528 x	@PatGallen_975 tweeted this 3 days ago and it's happening again. http://t.co/Hv77Wr4p2n
18171321_390253086809522177 x	Speaking of completely annoying. John Tortorella.
18171321_380523472793120768 x	Is that Mike Vick cure auto commercial the best they could come up with? Come  on my 9 year old cousin could do better.
18171321_384834131877953536 x	Delmon Young playing in a meaningful baseball game is a shamockery.
18171321_422375181487968256 x	Crazy Eagles fan - would you live in Antarctica for 6 months if it meant a Super Bowl? (We're ask the tough questions).
