14127590_327448683400548353 x	I dunno, this Donovan McNabb-EJ Manuel story feels like it needed more one-sentence paragraphs. http://t.co/0zYJ7tZ4RH

14127590_273245102682546178 x	Do things besides offensive lines get described as "patchwork"?
14127590_388124237921550336 x	In case you missed @igglesblog today, sure looks like "NFL Passing Concepts" aren't beyond Chippah. http://t.co/JZ3nxOlhmf
14127590_387597453551091713 x	@smartfootball or that Chip isn't super forthcoming about injuries. Like when he claims to not know injury details at pressers.
14127590_390121935830777856 x	Sure, small sample size for Chippah, but who do you think is better at their job, Chip Kelly or Howie Roseman? And is it even close?
14127590_270262531069718529 x	There's still time. RT @scrappleSports: If the Eagles lost those games instead of win, they could have been in play for Matt Barkley.
