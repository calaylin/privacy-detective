1963053427_394553985446989824 x	@RoobCSN Thank god, Kelly all three of his quarterbacks and his offense sucks
1963053427_394553697659015169 x	@EaglesShows @RicohTweets @Eagles Will he talk about his terrible decisions and offense?
1963053427_394552070789165057 x	@Ike58Reese Ike he's a duck not an eagle

1963053427_392659644822597632 x	@Jeff_McLane @MikeSielski They should so long as runs to the hole instead of dancing at the line
1963053427_392646581880909824 x	@RoobCSN @JoeB_OandBP Bar band, seriously?  say that after tonight's show and you will confirm lack of music sense.
1963053427_392645964810715136 x	@PearlJam Been going since 94 and yesterday was one of the best!  Hope tonight is a repeat, amazing, boys!
1963053427_391187526901186561 x	@RealRocket22 Toc what do you think the flyers need to do?  Trades keep working as is, bring up some kids?  G looks lost, and D looks old
1963053427_391014896944820225 x	@RealRocket22 can we agree that #5 is garbage?
1963053427_391016218695847936 x	@RealRocket22 5 hasn't been good in sometime (actually terrible) 22 was our best dman last yr so he deserves a pass.y I was bugging u on 8
1963053427_391006945618182144 x	@tpanotchCSN Watching the game tonight
1963053427_390295213832683520 x	@RealRocket22 Was it the transition of the play?  I think the crime was the second goal with 28 n 5 on the right with the play on the left.
1963053427_390453991509069824 x	@RealRocket22 toc I get that but at some point you have to flush him out right?  28&5 were covering air, wasn't a Canuck within 10ft
1963053427_390554789731254272 x	@RealRocket22 fair point but if my back was to 28&5 I would have assumed they would have rotated to the guy in front...
1963053427_390294526939922432 x	@BroadStBull Delusional...

1963053427_390283397660442624 x	@tpanotchCSN Claude and coburn did a hell of job protecting the wrong side
1963053427_390278498998562817 x	@PearlJam @SonsofAnarchy They did it again! Only "grunge" band to make/earn artist status...each album profiles their stages in life, beauty
1963053427_390277707323703296 x	@tpanotchCSN Are you watching the game?  Opposite side of the net bud
