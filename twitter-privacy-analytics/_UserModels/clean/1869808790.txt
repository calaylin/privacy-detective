1869808790_392051477310881792 x	@eriksooy yeah the age would b the biggest thing, aint getting any younger n in sports thats always the case besides injury
1869808790_392056889288429568 x	@eriksooy more of the option would b vanek, but i think hes to much $$$ need a sniper though

1869808790_391968820996620288 x	@tytompkins19 i think voracek can open space for giroux but humor me for a sec. In this sedin's rumor, how n what would it take??lol
1869808790_391969946768797696 x	@tytompkins19 haha yeah completely unrealistic, n fact that they both have to b together makes it more, would they ever split?
1869808790_391968594407735297 x	@tytompkins19 pronger deal? Yeah if we really continue to fall we may end up getting a top pick n we would benefit more from it

1869808790_391234723340881920 x	He has been moving the puck better, winning battles, i c his confidence coming out with each game, 50-60 pt. Season imo
1869808790_391234361900924929 x	Another decent outing from b.schenn although he should have buried that puck last night, it was bouncing around though...
1869808790_391233313006161920 x	@DNFlyers another big question frank please give me your opinion, what is going to happen with coburn???
1869808790_391233010026029056 x	@DNFlyers bring up olly n trade mez for our own $$
1869808790_391015656671674368 x	Game was closer than the score says...fuck....
1869808790_391019152636661760 x	@eriksooy i should restate that, it was terrible esp. In 2nd period when pens legit couldnt b stopped i im aiming more towards 3rd per
1869808790_391020514288091136 x	@eriksooy im totally with u bro im just trying to make light of this horrible situation, 6 days of prac. Will b good to practice system
1869808790_391024258593607680 x	@eriksooy look schenn is looking like his confidence is getting better so ive been happy so far with em, coots needs line mates
1869808790_391026756595236864 x	@eriksooy everyone feeling that way, flyers r stuck in the 70's snider doesnt want to admit it, feel bad for lavy but hated dump n chase
1869808790_391018288933011456 x	@eriksooy well just the third period but yeah gave crosby a goal for 7 straight now, homer fired imo
1869808790_391019369016623104 x	@eriksooy trade off mez or coburn
1869808790_391014590064390144 x	Well needed i may add though!

1869808790_390472852430139392 x	Team struggles affecting multiple players for #flyers solid performance last night, have to finish in 3rd and put up more than 2 goals!
1869808790_390236940131659776 x	Final thought Giroux big contract, gets the ''C'' the golf thingy, line mates, get it back on page, put shit behind em, when he does #letsgo
1869808790_390236357257625600 x	Giroux has to get confidence back, get voracek n him killing it again, he says game is beautiful but not having fun, coaches can help that
1869808790_390235485056299008 x	Both players going through similar type struggles, stats pretty close in comparison n soon this talk will b an after thought #relax
1869808790_390234851565400064 x	My opinion on why Giroux playing a bit diff. Other than injury n constant line mates changing, look at e.staal, very simular in a way folks.
1869808790_390232496144932865 x	@tpanotchCSN what type of season will Giroux have? Injury still bothering em? Line mates changing alot? Reminds me of e.staal struggles
1869808790_390232045622149120 x	RT @tpanotchCSN: yes, the Flyers and Oilers have talked in recent weeks but I dont see it happening with Yakupov. Lotta struggling clubs ca?
1869808790_390231951711674368 x	@JohnBorukCSN ok heres my thought, eric stall went through same thing, he'll b fine, think about that!
1869808790_390158243756249088 x	Still early but so far been happy with b.schenn's play, needs to continue to grow confidence, keep plahing his game and finish finish finish
1869808790_390157935936307200 x	Flys n nucks tonight, both on losing streaks, both need players to step up, who r u focusing harder on tonight, giroux, schenn, voracek ect.
1869808790_389942441828433920 x	@JohnBorukCSN @ALLsportsINTEL no thanks, guy just quoted as playing "his game" so forecheck n checking not ur game? Welcome to nhl bro
