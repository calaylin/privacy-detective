730164385_394558853376786432 x	@EaglesNews1 Barkley had plenty of time to study the defense. Don't make excuses because they lost.
730164385_394559934085332992 x	@EaglesNews1 yes, and he had all week to watch film. We knew Foles was going to be out, so it was all about Vick and Barkley
730164385_394563152018280448 x	@EaglesNews1 You might think Barkley is a better player, but Vick is better for THIS offense
730164385_394563989918609409 x	@EaglesNews1 threat to run
730164385_392011238978228224 x	@EaglesNews1 .......... defensive genius?
