504769838_393589762272935936 x	@TheGalviz_05 tomorrow is the eagles vs pats game?
504769838_393603649215012864 x	@TheGalviz_05 well now it seems as if I have plans
504769838_393604020910051328 x	@TheGalviz_05 well it's interesting to see,let's just hope the mission QB can actually throw a ball
504769838_393605522164690944 x	@TheGalviz_05 http://t.co/axIh1mH76t this seems more like the Mission QB
504769838_393606371804856320 x	@TheGalviz_05 the team is sad,they lost to Roma.....oh well once an eagle always an eagle
504769838_393612229779525632 x	@Dustin4king6 @TheGalviz_05 Canchola deserved it,although he wasn't that great, he was better than Jerry,that guy can't play QB
504769838_393607261408354304 x	@TheGalviz_05 not just that,they have a small team,most players are playing both O and D,the QB is a CB,it's ridiculous
504769838_393608305349644289 x	@TheGalviz_05 it's going to take a few years for them to recover to  a district winning team
504769838_393609519227338752 x	@TheGalviz_05 sadly every "qb" now just wants to do the option offense and it just doesn't work if you aren't smart or talented
504769838_393610129381146624 x	@TheGalviz_05 kids these days...that's why they don't ever progress,at least in mission
504769838_393611553309614080 x	@TheGalviz_05 they just need to focus on the game and not what they wear,they need to act like dogs! http://t.co/XsmAJ1MNH7
504769838_392877452143259648 x	@TheGalviz_05 @ericcc17 http://t.co/O6ZkmVRlyD there's a sports science on it
504769838_392879017004511233 x	@TheGalviz_05 @ericcc17 they need to do it on something,there's only so much you can do in sports
504769838_392879512276316161 x	@TheGalviz_05 I remember watching that game, it was pretty funny,I hate the jets so much
504769838_392879819265826817 x	@TheGalviz_05 Rex Ryan talks way too mush trash,it gets to me
504769838_392880372033150976 x	@TheGalviz_05 yeah he did,I wish his arrogance would slim down,the jets suck
504769838_392872169438334976 x	What if the superbowl is the Cowboys and the Broncos,neither QB can handle the clutch,the game would never end
504769838_392875370476605440 x	@TheGalviz_05 lol and neither of them have a good defense so they'd probably just drop the balls,it sounds like a game for the punters lol
