209428983_392848320068345856 x	@mccue_dawn @MikeVick You can't think of anyone you respect more? How about a guy that does a regular job and never killed any dogs?
209428983_392981492005343232 x	@GlenPhilly He can be forgiven, it doesn't mean I need to give him more respect that anyone else.
209428983_393166921308573696 x	@GlenPhilly Thats where we disagree I'm saying he has earned less respect from me. I think a lot others deserve more. I don't hate the guy.
209428983_393191244522086400 x	@GlenPhilly as far as ball players go, I agree with you on that one.
209428983_393329067808030720 x	@GlenPhilly Foles looked terrible last Sunday but he's shown some good stuff. I'd say Vick, with that type of offense though.
209428983_392860435625820160 x	@sjs856 Maybe. Those would be called accidents.
209428983_392862518177456128 x	@sjs856 limiting ones self to a regular job is an accident? Please elaborate.
209428983_392866238168580096 x	@sjs856 I agree, but being great at football doesn't negate other deficiencies like high character. Thus, Vick having not earned my respect.
209428983_392981910567538689 x	@comptyler @sjs856 yeah, maybe. Doesn't mean he's earned my respect.
209428983_393024783861813249 x	@comptyler @sjs856 possibly.  I still have a hard time thinking @mccue_dawn can't think of ANYONE she respects more.
209428983_393030025420623872 x	@sjs856 @comptyler @mccue_dawn I've done somethings I regret but being apologetic shouldn't warrant me praise.
209428983_393040289109381120 x	@mccue_dawn I understand you forgive him. That's good. But u said u don't respect anyone more than him. Teachers, firemen, pastors?
209428983_393106625596112896 x	@mccue_dawn Pretty much. Kurt Warner is a good one.
209428983_392859406570110977 x	@mccue_dawn I don't need to be forgiven.
209428983_392860840418095104 x	@mccue_dawn Since when is killing dogs for fun perfect behavior? I'd more call that rational behavior.
