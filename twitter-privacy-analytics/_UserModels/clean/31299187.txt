31299187_352198953984458752 x	@tpanotchCSN Watch Coburn and 1-2 other roster players get moved so we can get a D and a goalie.
31299187_352198342077460481 x	@sbaickerCSN Must move Coburn, might have to move Talbot, maybe kiss Gagne goodbye. With Vinny coming, need room for goalie and a D.
31299187_352149212516990977 x	@tpanotchCSN Peckham is RFA. Has to be cheaper than Coburn & Oilers must toss in more to make the deal work. Need to clear more cap space.

31299187_351434291835703296 x	@FlyersNation This pick opens up potential to unload Coburn and his $ to get a goalie and forward.
