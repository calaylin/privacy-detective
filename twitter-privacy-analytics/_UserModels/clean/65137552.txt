65137552_120609283728617472 x	Hey, Tra Thomas actually made a good point: you need downhill, physical linebackers to play wide nine.
65137552_120599817390010368 x	Eagles defense remains a rudderless ship, from what I can see.

65137552_379445501651066880 x	Brandon Boykin can play. Three more like him, Eagles would have an NFL secondary.

65137552_394943433917620225 x	Here we go. This caller is "bored out of my mind" and says Chip needs a franchise quarterback. Howie "understands where you're coming from."
65137552_394822719461945344 x	Chip seemed stunned that Mike Vick's hammy wasn't right yesterday, after 3 weeks. Guess they didnt have any 33-year-old players at Oregon...

65137552_394540579238846464 x	At this point, the Eagles' defense has to know the offense isn't scoring.
65137552_386928325949534208 x	Whichever way this replay ruling goes, I still say the NFL has made catching a football ridiculously complicated. Feet down, ball in hands..
