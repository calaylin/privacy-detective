1209603074_394628495407448064 x	@highkin the commercials/music playing just get earlier and earlier every year, drives me nuts.
1209603074_394623642253815808 x	Love the Brandon Davies signing.

1209603074_394576052950798336 x	@BillSimmons I had to start him and Zac Stacy this week. Ellington is my life boat.

1209603074_394558160649744385 x	Wait, did Terrelle Pryor really run for a 93 yard touchdown, or is ESPN Fantasy buggin?
1209603074_394558932149997568 x	@FightinPhin just saw the replay, he torched their defense haha
1209603074_394555363606798336 x	Man, I can't wait for the NBA to start.
1209603074_394557044226678784 x	@ecut37 Bron, Rose returning, couple teams with young guys ready to blossom (Pelicans), it's going to be an awesome year.
1209603074_394549023756914688 x	@LesBowen dealt with two injured quarterbacks and a third-string rookie?

1209603074_394540141231878144 x	DeSean, just short of the first down with space to get it, runs sideways. Genius.
1209603074_394539389151223808 x	Good thing about this horrible Eagles game is that it has given me the time to finally read a lot of @HPbasketball 's fantastic NBA preview.
1209603074_394535710167822336 x	Notice that common thread among all 3 QB's is holding ball too long. More likely that receivers blow rather than all have same problem.
1209603074_394537426502176768 x	@BroadStrBully never thought I'd miss Jeremy Maclin but holy shit he'd be a gift from the angels right now
1209603074_394536056298958849 x	RT @BrandonGowton: Chip Kelly's offense has been figured out. Take away the quarterback and it totally falls apart.
1209603074_394535286123687936 x	@And_Porter the only thing that's controversial is how bad they've been
1209603074_394535955844968448 x	@And_Porter haha I just meant in a, "You think you're playing bad? WATCH THIS" way

1209603074_394529613025525760 x	@vandegryffindor yeah the decision not to run is just bizarre.
1209603074_394525912143638528 x	UHHHHHHH was that actually good?

1209603074_393856605957390336 x	If expiring Gortat is worth a first rounder, the return for Thad has to be ridiculous, right?
1209603074_393857555828858881 x	@SpikeEskin granted that's just one guy, but think there's gotta be at least one team that really likes him.
1209603074_393861262142353409 x	@SpikeEskin  that said, I don't think Philly gets better value for Thad, only that I think they should.
1209603074_393860837926244353 x	@SpikeEskin maybe I just don't get Gortat love. Put up 11 and 8 on a bad team with league average PER. per-36 isn't mind blowing either.
1209603074_393858187834966018 x	Still don't see how Phoenix is worse than Philly. Dragic + Bledsoe better duo than any pair on Sixers.
1209603074_393857386701922304 x	@SpikeEskin I think you're selling Thad's perception around league a little short. Browns pre-coaching view on him was glowing.
1209603074_393855383439433728 x	@DerekBodnerNBA still think Bledsoe and Dragic are better than anyone on Sixers roster
1209603074_393850713849462784 x	Woah. RT @ESPNSteinLine: Hearing: Suns are trading Marcin Gortat to the Wizards. Okafor on his way to Phoenix. More details to come

1209603074_393555692230946816 x	@rich_hofmann I thought they;'d have to get a third "guy", but if Parsons plays this well? shit.
1209603074_393557056377987073 x	@rich_hofmann of course, that's a big if, but i think combo of another year post surgery + removal from bad situation is big for him
1209603074_393556893680955393 x	@rich_hofmann I'm really high on them. People just like to (rightfully) dump on Howard, but if he is the Dwight of old? Team is scary.
