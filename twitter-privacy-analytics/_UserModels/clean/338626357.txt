338626357_371292006573953024 x	@r_a_kapp   Bought the LP new in 1987.   1 careful owner. Never selling.  (Made that mistake once before with a 335)
338626357_371379179725799424 x	@r_a_kapp   Yeah, I always regret selling my Tobacco SB 335 too.  BIG mistake that one. #gutted
338626357_371291679959318528 x	@r_a_kapp   Cheers!  I also have these 2 beauties.   The Tele is a parts special, my favourite guitar. http://t.co/CqSc0p1Wed
338626357_371378008055373824 x	@r_a_kapp   Yeah, saw 'em earlier, always have a nose when guitars are involved!  Like the rig behind.....#classic
