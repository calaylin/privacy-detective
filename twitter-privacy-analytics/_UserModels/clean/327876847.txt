327876847_392042675840753664 x	@EaglesNews1 Yeah me too, they are terrible.
327876847_392041321806184448 x	@EaglesNews1 You not think we would trade up
327876847_392038784831078401 x	@EaglesNews1 Is he eligible for the draft?
327876847_392039264873365504 x	@EaglesNews1 I like him Boyd Mariota or Bridgewater.
327876847_392028300677500928 x	@EaglesNews1 Qb
327876847_392029623175102464 x	@EaglesNews1 I want Mariota if he goes this year. For real. I'm not drafting another Barkley or Foles. We can get defence through out.
