143991014_377220133522903042 x	@LesBowen this officiating crew is having a brutal night.
143991014_377212441949507584 x	@LesBowen encouraging that Eagles receivers are wide open. Bad that Vick doesn't notice or hit them.
143991014_364211211694379012 x	@KevinCooney part of losing the culture of winning is letting those guys remain on the roster. Send a damn message.
143991014_363147430780342273 x	@lesliegudel @rkuestnercsn if Ruben was smart, he'd pay whatever salary he needed to to get a useful piece and get rid of him ASAP
143991014_362979364574478336 x	@ByDavidMurphy finally, you forgot that trades are always possible.
143991014_362303641828327424 x	@lesliegudel translation, if Ruben really keeps Young, Delmon meet the bench, bench meet Delmon.
143991014_356996440712691712 x	@RoobCSN @derrick3DPhilly @heshyshmu uh, he doesn't project to an MLB regular and Franco is likely the 3B by late 2014/early 2015.
143991014_354446627056001025 x	@magelb the biggest series may actually be this weekend when there is a letdown vs. a crappy White Sox club. A good team buries them.
143991014_352083654933098496 x	@LesBowen @JordanRaanan the issue is really the bullpen. Started the trip 3-4, but could/should easily be 5-2 or 6-1.
143991014_399607700058685440 x	@LesBowen had all day too. Critical 2nd year mistake.
