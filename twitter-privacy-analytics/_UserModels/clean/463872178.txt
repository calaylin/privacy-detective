463872178_380904749257994241 x	@WarrenSapp I think he showed him that he knew his weakness was defense, since he's the dummy who drafted most of it!

463872178_380900274644471808 x	@Ike58Reese wait why didn't we draft @Earl_Thomas again??? Secondary is so bad and Vick looked awful.
463872178_380898119585902592 x	@espn every time I see the Eagles safety's miss coverage I think why didn't we draft @Earl_Thomas again????
463872178_380894937552003072 x	@SportsCenter @espn lol thanks Vick. Appreciate all those yards going to waste.
