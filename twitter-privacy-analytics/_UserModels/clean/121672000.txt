121672000_385687263104868352 x	Leigh: For Buddy to play until 36 is "pie in the sky". Says salary cap went up 300% from start to end of Lynch's 10 yr deal. Won't this time
121672000_385916066989219840 x	@Kingclivemc Its in the salary cap though
121672000_384885796676718592 x	My @superfooty analysis on Buddy's departure. How does the AFL allow this? http://t.co/F0sZrjEbVb
121672000_384899181237657601 x	@jt_or_grabba Yeah the afl is considering that option very closely

121672000_384875620359892992 x	Bravo Sydney for being bold & adventurous with their cap space. But other rivals can't be bold because they don't have $1m extra in cap
121672000_384866752871403520 x	Bang. Giants say Buddy is going to the Swans. Have withdrawn their offer. Massive news. Massive fallout. Extraordinary
121672000_381366640878682112 x	Hawks are $1.40 for the flag. Freo should be favourites for the premiership  by the time they finish off against Sydney. They won't be
121672000_379437871280578560 x	Chapman jumped slightly off the ground and hit a bloke with the ball & gets reckless. Richards picked a bloke off yet its negligent. Bizarre
121672000_361618883733504001 x	Can see why the Dogs are one of a number of clubs keen on Jesse White. He wants to play regular footy. Did himself no harm v Richmond
121672000_350596307641053184 x	Hard to see how Mumford, Pyke, Reid, Tippett fit into the Sydney side. Will it influence GWS to go even harder at Mummy? #16sausages
