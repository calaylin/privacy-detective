1935704636_389480741987692544 x	RT @lawlornfl: Tampa allows 17.5 points per game. Eagles scoring 31 is impressive. Wasn't a bunch of gift points on turnovers and STs. Long?
1935704636_389480468271607808 x	Boykin has to lead the league in dropped ints lol
1935704636_389479818280321024 x	@_d2cool go back and watch how they gave drew brees trouble a couple of weeks ago
1935704636_389478499289149440 x	@_d2cool he was better for a couple of preseason drives
1935704636_389478266354274305 x	@CarlAllDay @_d2cool  I wouldn't call it that because Romo does similar things when things break down Vick ain't patient with his reads
1935704636_389476877385363456 x	@_d2cool shady got 100 on the ground Vick is done man Foles is the better qb for us
1935704636_389475797066866689 x	@CarlAllDay Foles lol
1935704636_389475039143530496 x	Nick needs to be the starter

1935704636_389462278506315778 x	Fletcher is our best corner!
1935704636_389458682335219713 x	This defense is horrible as a unit
1935704636_389452324567269376 x	Shady gotta chill leaving his feet so much
1935704636_389437844219265025 x	Easy money on that drive
1935704636_389429064970555393 x	Peyton should be allowed to play one quarter only today vs the jags lol
1935704636_389415465493475328 x	The Nick Foles era begins today baby!!!!

1935704636_388464323674533888 x	What should the giants do with the #1 pick in the 2014 draft?
1935704636_388341040354443264 x	@CarlAllDay man you must of forgot about Bobby carpenter ctfu!!
1935704636_388340758228787200 x	In a year or two Andrew Luck will be the best qb in the league dude is amazing for a second year qb
1935704636_387578445439700992 x	I'm convinced people want Vick to be the starter because he's black
1935704636_387389178725826560 x	Matty Ice gotta step up tonight!
1935704636_387395522631573504 x	@CarlAllDay yeah I'm starting to think it's not their year lol
1935704636_387396148316880896 x	@CarlAllDay well they was 13-3 last year they offense got great players they just not clicking
1935704636_387396808458403840 x	@CarlAllDay it comes with the territory it's the same with the Yankees and Lakers every sport got that one team everyone focus on
1935704636_387397361242505216 x	@CarlAllDay I agree

1935704636_387257725685870592 x	"@lawlornfl: The #Eagles had some young defenders step up and make plays on Sunday. There is hope. http://t.co/VlF6wEPAEf"
1935704636_387243743264653312 x	@CarlAllDay nothing wrong with losing to a better team he outplayed the best qb but that defense needs some adjustments play more man
1935704636_387255577749254145 x	@CarlAllDay it suits y'all personnel better
1935704636_387000422445359104 x	@CarlAllDay how you talking shit after a loss lol ain't no morale victories man
1935704636_387000943314993152 x	@CarlAllDay I never seen a below 500 team say they're way better then another y'all ok nothing special bro be real
1935704636_387001791243894784 x	@CarlAllDay that's like saying I'm the tallest midget in the bar lol false hope off of what you really think y'all can win something?
1935704636_387004255418458112 x	@CarlAllDay only a fool would bet on any team in this division to do anything prideful after a loss I see lol
1935704636_387005077975998464 x	@CarlAllDay honestly I it's not hope it's reality we got the same record your opinions don't change that our defense is below average
1935704636_387001999855980544 x	RT @BrianDawkins: What makes that pick even worse is that was a 3 man rush. And Murray was WIDE OPEN for a 7 on 7 pitch and catch right in ?
1935704636_386995027836432384 x	This has been an awesome game
1935704636_386991445921792000 x	@CarlAllDay whatever makes your day homie
