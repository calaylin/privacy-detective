27264172_392113803934314496 x	@Solveetcoagula5 @dom9brown Dom's entitled to his choice of teams. When he wins here he'll come aboard.
27264172_391015768525393920 x	I knew they would struggle scoring. Had no idea they'd be. 1-7. That's a big hole. Worst 8 game start in team history.

27264172_396461502850293760 x	We went to dinner with friends. Took a break  from sports for a few. Had a great time. Retuned and saw a 7-0 home drubbing. 3-9.? WTH? Sad
27264172_391189625072406528 x	Ruben? Michael Martinez? Again? And you want this fan base to take your aggressive off season seriously?
27264172_389572289827995649 x	Why must we be forced to endure political diatribes with our sports? I love Costas but I'm tired of politics everywhere.
27264172_387216880110690304 x	Is Chip Kelly the longest tenured coach in Philadelphia ?
27264172_223608562486755328 x	And introducing Marla Hooch. What a hitter !
27264172_279998423191670784 x	I like the Adams signing. Don't enjoy the picking up of Lannan. I'm guessing swisher would be final piece but Rube may wait until Deadline
27264172_389183272968007680 x	Don't want to pile on a bad situation but this Flyers team moves in slow motion. I mean slow. Like really slow.
27264172_370680204697415680 x	Join me & @MtAiryPhil975  on @975TheFanatic Eagles talk,Great voices, and looking for Slogans for the 2013 Birds and a station announcement
27264172_396816982864961537 x	Dude. I can't stand the NBA and  I'm a hockey fan but I watched the 76ers. I like a good story. And the 76ers are a good story. That was fun
27264172_387246045056352256 x	The Flyers have hired former PHI players Homer,Murray,Barber,Stevens,Berube=1 Cup final. Lavy,Quinn,Shero,Keenan all Outsiders= 7 Finals
27264172_295864308519280640 x	Have never been a fan. Never. Ever.?@cjchamp2001 why is michael  leighton still on this team?Does anyone besides holmgren this guy can play?
27264172_208377377779236865 x	25 years ago tonight the flyers lost game 7 to edmonton...it still hurts...what was your most painful loss? talk about it on 94WIP NOW
27264172_374844355863134208 x	@PatGallen_975 didn't. Catch that ! And I retweeted that. !' Lol
27264172_374886345463721984 x	@PatGallen_975 would love to see what he does in camp next spring
27264172_374717458219020289 x	And I still don't like Jonathan Papelbon. He's a very good pitcher. But For whatever reason , he's never connected with me as a PHILLIE.
27264172_374722350459420672 x	@WEST6 hard to describe. He's just a outsider. Just doesn't seem Philly to me
27264172_366027354134421505 x	Not bad. Better than I expected. Vick and offense were pretty good. Still worried about that secondary. But overall not bad
27264172_347841102822379520 x	Its with Great excitement that I announce I'm now working for 97.5 the Fanatic ESPN radio in Philadelphia. Thank you WIP for 8 great years!
27264172_399628015887319040 x	Enough with the style point tweets. Who cares ?  He's effective. No ?
27264172_387233723558526976 x	Very caustic presser Understand Snider wants to win but looking outside the organization is  fair question, and its something they should do
27264172_398471893360996352 x	Have a Stephen Starr Gift card. Tell me Philadelphia, which eatery is best and worth the visit?
27264172_397949648146415616 x	I knew the Flyers were going to mediocre but not this bad. I mean c'mon , 13 games , 9 PTs and no goals from your captain? Ugh
27264172_394658671936159744 x	Isn't it time to move forward? What has Vick done in Phila? Great stretch in '10. Injured. Inconsistent. Divided a fan base. Think future
