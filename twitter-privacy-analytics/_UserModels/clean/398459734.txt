398459734_351883330049945601 x	@rvacanti I know. I'm like OMG. Sooooo annoying!!
398459734_327559271657115648 x	@BroadStBull from what I saw, this was not even close.  He was by far the MVP What do you think?
398459734_324341506586603520 x	@DNFlyers some are saying knee/leg but you are the only one saying abdomen
398459734_324251185315975168 x	@BroadStBull has there ever been a year where this many d men have been injured?  I don't remember one
398459734_323965601884274689 x	@RandyJMiller do you think Gagne is back next year?  I think he has been pretty decent
398459734_323593619581849601 x	@BroadStBull whenever you mention ruff as coach a piece of me dies
398459734_322931702731247616 x	@RandyJMiller is this a joke?  Lindys tough style? Haha
398459734_322932875064389633 x	@RandyJMiller I live in buffalo now. Ruff is terrible, not aggressive.  Rather have Lavy. Thanks for responding.  Have a good one
398459734_322934733321412609 x	@RandyJMiller I hear you there. It's been a strange year. I hope they just relax, don't do anything crazy and see what happens next year
398459734_322936380835647488 x	@RandyJMiller do you think mason can be what he was?  If so, I think you have to buy Bryz out. He has been ok this year but that contract..
398459734_320707688575148033 x	@RandyJMiller wish hartnell would just stop talking. He does nothing until they are down a few then takes dumb penalties.
398459734_319248988354273281 x	@BroadStBull for a guy who has 0 goals?  Glad the flyers have not done anything stupid...yet
398459734_319185085347799040 x	@RandyJMiller agree but I was ok with them taking a chance at suter & parise even if it meant losing jagr. + carle = overpaid now
398459734_319182227030286338 x	@RandyJMiller if Giroux needs a 40 yr old winger to play at his best, flyers are in trouble   #rmloveshotdogs
398459734_318543170222845952 x	@pham1717 how were the hot dogs tonight?  More specifically, your ninth hot dog?
398459734_318535118459396098 x	@RandyJMiller how were the hot dogs tonight?
398459734_318194330537959424 x	@johnclarknbc10 @broadstbull wow John you can read, congratulations
398459734_316750353313980416 x	@davegisaac hope he is talking about himself.
398459734_316733934081818624 x	@BroadStBull is that bryz's fault too?
398459734_316732825556635648 x	@RandyJMiller heard you ate 11 hot dogs at the game tonight..get a hold of yourself
398459734_316278759726669824 x	@BroadStBull next 5 home games are the season. Need to go 4 of 5 to have a chance at the playoffs.  News on grossman?
398459734_313813453473189888 x	@BroadStBull feels like I have been watching hartnell from a few seasons ago...no scoring and dumb penalties
398459734_313808551917277187 x	@howardeskin does anyone really even care about Bynam anymore?
398459734_313348965720535040 x	@ctherien6 wish he was banned from everything relating to the flyers
398459734_312235067177058304 x	@davegisaac is this an assumption or do you have an actual source?
398459734_313325171807248386 x	@davegisaac I have
398459734_313109453979398146 x	@davegisaac can you guys stop with the love fest of ex flyers? He's been good for like 10 games.  Sports media over acts to everything
398459734_312755924626444290 x	@BroadStBull @tpanotchcsn why is panotch in charge of anything? He proves over and over again what an idiot he is
398459734_312232066391617536 x	@RandyJMiller Lindy Ruff?  Your kidding me right?
398459734_312037216660643840 x	@DNFlyers can you tell hartnell that if he is going to take a penalty at least make it a good hit not a DB slash
398459734_312018679430787072 x	@RandyJMiller when does the captain get blamed for lack of leadership?  We all know this would not be going on if Pronger was there
398459734_312017212305186817 x	@BroadStBull any line coots is on is terrible
398459734_312009719189483520 x	@BroadStBull Lavy is the least of my worries. Coach & goalie are always easy targets for the media and fans
398459734_311995638051135488 x	@RandyJMiller I want to see Lavy stand up and either punch Briere or Coots square in the face
398459734_311991190641852416 x	@RandyJMiller are you watching the game?  And sober?
398459734_311959090010157057 x	@BroadStBull @tpanotchcsn they probably wanted someone who could provide information in a grammatically correct way. That would exclude TP
398459734_311559879917703169 x	@BroadStBull is center briere's natural position?  When he had over 30 points in their cup run, wasn't he center?
398459734_311170286944919552 x	@RealGlenMacnow you are crazy to want to get rid of Laviolette. Who would you rather? Ruff?  Now live in Buffalo and Ruff is just awful
398459734_311124980924555264 x	@ESPN_Colin god, even as a little kid you look like a huge tool
398459734_311103321698103297 x	@WIPMorningShow was so nice to listen to the show last week.  Now that Angelo is back, tough to listen
398459734_310508461467242496 x	@RealGlenMacnow I miss gargano
398459734_310508157917077504 x	@BroadStHockey have you watched the jackets games?  Not many shots come wide open 5 feet from the net. They are playing this cool thing..D
398459734_310497490665345024 x	@howardeskin get your nasty beard out of you eyes and type English
398459734_310497128021635072 x	@BroadStBull that's hilarious coming from a player who you don't even notice on the ice?
398459734_310485021486096384 x	@BroadStBull and the d leaves people wide open in front of the net...guess they are screwed
398459734_310476612686716930 x	@BroadStBull coach is not the problem.  Why bruins forwards get back hard  on d and our lazy ass forwards take casual strides to get back?
398459734_310466272020279296 x	@RandyJMiller why no blame on timmonen ever?  He takes at least one bad penalty a game cause he is the slowest guy on the ice
398459734_310082568630452224 x	@BroadStBull any reason Briere is still on the second line?  Also, why is he not playing center? Isn't that his natural position?
398459734_309866727519436801 x	@ctherien6 as much as I hate to say it, it has been tough to watch Briere and timmonen this year
398459734_309834261240889344 x	@BroadStBull can't believe I am saying this, but I think I actually hate Neal more than Crosby
398459734_309696468149735425 x	@blakeshelton are you pooping in your new profile picture?
398459734_309411522180960256 x	@nufced Al, you have the most common sense of anyone who does what you do. Always enjoy listening to you
398459734_309340211094110208 x	@AnthonySan37 wow thanks for the useless information that most people reported yesterday
398459734_309404568284975105 x	@AnthonySan37 you reported it after it was already reported. You must be spending too much time with tpannach Your info is right, unlike his
398459734_309347742348611584 x	@realDonaldTrump  losers like Mac miller will come and go but The Donald will go down in history
398459734_309335900884713472 x	@tpanotchCSN wrong again Timmy. How does Eskin (who watches 0 flyers) get it right on the injury and you (who is there every second) can't?
398459734_309136569091096576 x	@RealGlenMacnow better question....When did our defense forget how to make a f-in line change?
398459734_309134963821912066 x	@tpanotchCSN blaming Bryzgalov for the d not knowing how to make proper line changes?  Your an idiot
398459734_309025099326033920 x	@davegisaac when Mez is done being "sick" will he be back in?
398459734_307586826061897728 x	@tpanotchCSN I wish you could be put on waivers and picked up by Vancouver
398459734_302958633732423681 x	@BroadStBull G has been tough to watch this year. No emotion or intensity. If Bryzgalov was playing like G is you guys would be all over him
398459734_302105500290523137 x	@SportsRadioWIP @mikeandike94wip Vick will never get it. Excuse after excuse. Can't even stand listening to him
398459734_291684408212213760 x	@howardeskin stop with the chopper. Creepy
398459734_266368929180557312 x	@realDonaldTrump by far you are the best follow on twitter.  I told my wife to follow you and she won't stop talking about you now!
398459734_266038983484657665 x	@BroadStBull do you know what the unemployment rate is in PA?
398459734_265825785934397440 x	@rainnwilson @theonion that is hilarious!  Wonder if all the families who have lost loved ones fighting for the right to vote are laughing
398459734_265644716656300033 x	@hardball_chris you would say vote with your soul because if people voted with their brain and common sense your hero would be out #loser
