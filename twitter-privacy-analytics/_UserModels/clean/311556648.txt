311556648_372494226388299776 x	@ninjyatlaw Nori, plus carrot and burdock root saut?ed in garlic and olive oil. Omelette is just eggs, 1tsp white wine, 1tsp tamari.
311556648_372495392719388672 x	@ninjyatlaw Thank you. It actually tasted a bit like sushi, except low carb.
311556648_372495946971508736 x	@ninjyatlaw Yes. The nori and burdock root just taste like sushi. You could also make regular sushi with shredded lettuce instead of rice.
311556648_372497068159279104 x	@ninjyatlaw Riced cauliflower if you're feeling motivated. Use it instead of rice. http://t.co/5PyQJXIqdD
