136381415_394507816402042880 x	It amazes me how far this fanbase has fallen in the last five years or so. There are tens of thousands of empty seats minutes before kick.
136381415_391155177262436352 x	I really believe people get trapped believing the brand of football they enjoy watching (Running QB's) win in #NFL. They flat out don't.
136381415_387946089245990912 x	#Eagles offense is racking up yards..They are first team in #NFL history to accumulate 1,200 passing and 875 rushing through first 5 games.
136381415_385413050796621824 x	Wow, best selling author Tom Clancy has died.. Rest in peace.
136381415_390200545379487744 x	If the season ended today the #Eagles would host the #49ers in the NFC Wild Card round. #Eaglestalk #NFL
136381415_390203732429766656 x	@jetblackbrian What tie breaker would that be? Eagles are 2-0 in NFC East, 3-0 in NFC..
136381415_389441249843101696 x	Great backside pursuit by Chung there. #Eagles
136381415_387269591430594561 x	What I don't understand about #Flyers firing  Laviolette is the timing. Why not make move in offseason when you could have hired Lindy Ruff?
136381415_387271513621409793 x	That's the point. Maybe it's time for a culture change. RT:"@973espn: @MattLombardo975 because Ruff isnt a Flyers guy, you know that!?
136381415_381795833290964992 x	Just my speculation but @AdamSchefter report that a team has made 'serious offer' for #Browns Josh Gordon, I wouldn't be shocked if #Eagles
136381415_381807379849183232 x	Not sure hes on market.Seems like offensive fire sale. RT:@Stewball83: @MattLombardo975 @ChipKellysBalls @AdamSchefter what about Joe Haden?
136381415_381960441041125376 x	One game away from quarter poll of the season, what is your #Eagles grade after three games? @joestaszak975 & I want to know. (610)632-0975
136381415_377765805393330176 x	Chip Kelly could send McCoy, Vick and Jackson into the #NFL history book. #Eagles #Eaglestalk http://t.co/HpdEcAktV2
136381415_361917412867715072 x	Riley Cooper had a very strong day overall. #Eagles
136381415_391995472703139840 x	You needed half a yard.. And you kick a FG?! #Cowboys have a timeout and ball at midfield. #Eagles #Eaglestalk
136381415_389445817792495616 x	Even Ronde Barber sees offense moving at a quicker pace under Foles today. It's been that way since May. #Eagles
136381415_380898909603651584 x	Doesn't look like Vick is down.. That's a fumble, folks. #Eagles
136381415_377251034567307264 x	Shocked there wasn't a flag with Riley Cooper being dragged to the ground. #Eagles
136381415_377219094384480257 x	What if LeSean McCoy rushes for 100 yards in the first quarter? He already has 60...#Eagles
136381415_373225110590607360 x	Other than getting him some reps, I'm not sure what the point of playing Foles tonight was behind that offensive line. #Eagles
136381415_394564099423866880 x	Cary Williams: Not only are we losing games at home but we're losing fans too. They're not getting up on 3rd down, that would be nice.
