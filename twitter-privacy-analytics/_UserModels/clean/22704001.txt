22704001_392306534371188738 x	New Jersey is a better place than Pennsylvania today. #HappyMonday
22704001_392288254411554816 x	I can't post about my @PearlJam excitement on Facebook because it's broken so can we talk about it here? K thanks.
22704001_392292442394746880 x	@JMBstein Yeah, they'll start with Pendulum. How about a dream guess? Faithfull for Song #2.
22704001_395514569768325120 x	Headed to an Allen Iverson press conference today. Is it 2001 or 2013?
22704001_391015396855140352 x	The Flyers 1-7 record is their worst start to a season, ever. Previous "worst" was 1-6-1. #FlyersTalk
22704001_390995789314392064 x	Shots are 21-8 Penguins right now. Your Flyers are in this because Steve Mason.
22704001_387310070721019904 x	Can we chalk the 3-game timing to Holmgren's realization target is on his back, w/ Hextall in the wings? Holmgren knew he had to act quick.
22704001_387003849703059456 x	So I guess when Scott Laughton went back to Oshawa he took all the goals with him? Trying to think of other possibilities here ...
22704001_352205114527846400 x	Would a Flyers defense minus Coburn plus Streit really be that much better than last year's? I don't buy that.
22704001_352195442915811328 x	Yeah ... I don't think next year's Flyers are going to be a smartly constructed team.
22704001_390229180954451968 x	You people are ridiculous. Pink is an awesome color. I wish my hockey team wore pink jerseys. They'd look sick.
22704001_391032916290990080 x	My 10 observations from tonight's #Flyers loss: http://t.co/7i47aHaVvR What are some of yours?
22704001_388879939988365313 x	They don't have Warren Zevon at this karaoke place. So I'm gonna go with Britney Spears. You know. Just FYI.
