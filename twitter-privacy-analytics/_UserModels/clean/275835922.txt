275835922_390116576248475648 x	@TKBlueshirt I also heard some areas are now partial view from row 15 & back. Hope that's not true
275835922_390118232432340992 x	@TKBlueshirt Im in 222 row 16 so that should be fine too. I wonder if its a problem at the ends, seats are different in the corners.
275835922_390112368786939904 x	@TKBlueshirt @7BOOMERESIASON my Rep told me the screens were 9x10. Sounds ok, but why waste $ on a new SB when only 1/2 the fans can see it?
