1854011953_386940584713146368 x	There's one way to get in the game, BG.
1854011953_386940171410624512 x	Starting to become convinced the Eagles WR corps has a pact with Vick. "Don't worry Mike, we'll make sure Foles doesn't look good."
1854011953_386939393887313920 x	I'm glad Jacobs is a Giant again. All bark, no bite.
1854011953_386939159320858625 x	Fuuuuuuck Eli. That is all.
1854011953_386937548490018817 x	RT @lawlornfl: I just don't see how Eli Manning can expect to win a shootout against Alex Henery.

1854011953_386935289580515329 x	Been thinking; Chip Kelly is to rushing as Reid was to passing.
1854011953_386934287473188865 x	Boykin flagged for wiping out?
1854011953_386933258627194880 x	Giants acting all 4-0. Great job forcing a three and out on an offense using a backup QB and RB.
1854011953_386932521826402304 x	RT @PHSportsGoddess: So much arrogance for an 0-4 team. Cracks me up.
1854011953_386931290349379584 x	Bradley Fletcher looked like he was running in sludge.
1854011953_386918444655845377 x	RT @EaglesInsider: Mychal Kendricks recovers Brandon Jacobs fumble. No one forced it.
1854011953_386745221695807489 x	@BrandonGowton Appreciate the time saver, going to hold you to it!
1854011953_385129911318372352 x	I agree with Chip by not overhauling starters. Sadly, the guys out there on D are the best 11. It's not like Coleman can suddenly tackle.
1854011953_384115438369505280 x	@IgglesNest Sounds much worse than it probably was.
1854011953_382870446669975553 x	@terilyns68 Hey are there any EMBers or TATErs on Twitter? There aren't enough QB arguments on my timeline.
1854011953_382585857447694336 x	If Maclin were healthy and Britt was an Eagle, it'd be just like the 06 S Knights core. Jackson = Timmy Brown, Maclin = Tiquan Underwood.
1854011953_382585362092023809 x	A big part of me wants to see Kenny Britt trade to the Eagles simply because of how impressive he can be, like he was at Rutgers.
1854011953_382242005398470656 x	Appreciate the follows! I spammed too many timelines on my primary account, so this one is where I'll have my gameday outbursts.
1854011953_382221516911296512 x	RT @MWhickerOCR: Cardinals' Rashad Johnson lost part of his middle finger Sunday. Should not affect his play, but he won't be able to drive?
1854011953_380868033033433088 x	Welcome back, Mike.
1854011953_379298944838168576 x	I repeat, Nate Allen is just the worst. #couldhavehadEarl

1854011953_377746969017323520 x	Test, test. Ah, nobody's looking anyway.
