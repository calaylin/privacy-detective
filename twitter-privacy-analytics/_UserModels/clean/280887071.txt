280887071_358117789153763329 x	@sullythebeast Where is white racism?  Racial profiling for starters. BTW, you can know black people and still be/act racist.
280887071_358271013299027968 x	@sullythebeast Strange that you have chosen to attack me instead of making a point.  If that is all you have....Peace
280887071_358289597698027520 x	@sullythebeast You obviously feel rather than think.  Good luck with that.
280887071_358296956084289537 x	@sullythebeast Because, you have no argument and when counterpoints are brought to your attention, you cry.  Good luck with that.
280887071_358310193869750276 x	@sullythebeast Yes, you cry.  Please stop crying to me, your emotions and lack of argument is pointless.
280887071_358343649106468866 x	@sullythebeast :) Still crying with no argument.  I would offer you tissue if that would help.
