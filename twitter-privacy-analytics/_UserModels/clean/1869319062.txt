1869319062_387039824433004546 x	RT @WWE: We are currently experiencing technical difficulties with our #WWEBattleground broadcast. Please stand by for further updates.
1869319062_387039615225307136 x	Uh oh. Technical difficulties at #wwe #battleground
1869319062_387037380038770688 x	WWE Battleground result: CM Punk defeats Ryback. Match was good, but not great.
1869319062_387029990971150336 x	Bad spot for Kofi, Bray Wyatt. Crowd was hot for the last match and now a little exhausted. #wwe #battleground
1869319062_387027190455349248 x	The Shield deserve credit for that match, too. They continue to deliver when called upon. #wwe #battleground
1869319062_387026490182758401 x	Glad I was wrong about that match. What a match. What a difference emotional investment makes to a match.
1869319062_387026255788265473 x	WWE Battleground result: Rhodes family defeats The Shield in a great match. Best of the night so far.
1869319062_387025966880399360 x	BIONIC ELBOW!
1869319062_387021547841388544 x	Look at Goldust rockin' the Darth Maul face paint. #wwe #battleground.
1869319062_387022695109373952 x	@petzrawr Agreed.

1869319062_387022391374671872 x	Calling a Cody Rhodes heel turn here. Makes sense moving forward in my opinion.
1869319062_387020084121579520 x	WWE Battleground result: AJ Lee retains Divas Championship over Brie Bella.
1869319062_387017466523553793 x	WWE Battleground result: Curtis Axel retains IC title over R-Truth. Fairly entertaining match.
1869319062_387014218769104896 x	Antonio Cesaro is a beast. And highly under-utilized I might add.
1869319062_387012853187629057 x	The ring doesn't look like much of a battleground with pink ropes.
1869319062_387010800625258496 x	WWE Battleground result: Alberto Del Rio retains World title by forcing RVD to tap out. Good opening match to the show.
1869319062_387003149275238400 x	WWE Battleground results: Dolph Ziggler def. Damien Sandow in pre-show match.
1869319062_386996623743524864 x	Tony Romo just went from Dan Fouts back to normal, regular, interception-throwing Tony Romo.
