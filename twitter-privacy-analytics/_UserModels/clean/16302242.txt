16302242_247878837038379008 x	Ok, this officiating is not funny anymore. It's really bad and the NFL needs to do something about it. Seriously!
16302242_346449667636228096 x	Now we'll see how Spoelstra responds to Pops latest chess move. It's ain't checkers, that's for sure. We'll know the results in 12 minutes.
16302242_391744857800052737 x	Damn! Florida State is just giving it to Clemson right now. Boyd and the crew haven't shown up. Actually, they're just being outplayed.
16302242_383659431260463104 x	Thank you all of hanging with me today on TV and Radio. Sorry I don't have my usual energy. This Flu is kicking my butt, but I'm hanging!
16302242_394580860470444032 x	Wow! I'm shocked not only by the Redskins have played in tying the score, but also by how LOW the score is. Never saw this.

16302242_383426382165848064 x	Right now, Sam Bradford looks like Mark Sanchez! Doesn't help that Bowman steam rolls over Richardson and is bulling over everyone, though!
16302242_388511826096295936 x	I'm not going to lie: I'm flat-out miserable and sick to my stomach over these Giants. Minus-16 on Turnovers this season. Good Lord! #Sick

16302242_367322998606274560 x	You're pathetic, @Mike_Loveeee. 99 percent of the time I'm talking issues, sports and Black athletes. The second I say a negative word
16302242_342636438850007040 x	First take at the top of the hour on ESPN2. The crew's all together in Miami. My prediction is coming. Buckle up!
16302242_347178475737726977 x	Right now, @KingJames looks lost. One minute Leonard is on him. The next, it's Diaw. The next, S.A. is collapsing. He doesn't know what 2 do

16302242_267778035846086656 x	So much for all that talk about the Nick Foles starting in place of Vick. What a disaster.
