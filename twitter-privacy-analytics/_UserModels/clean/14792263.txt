14792263_393186145950912513 x	Per Lawprof Kaimi Wenger, Mary Anne Franks is now the victim of "bizarre, stalker-ish online attacks." http://t.co/yQUZ1bI9GK
14792263_393186626613940224 x	@Popehat I suspect the bizarre, stalkerish online attacks he is referring to is me and @MarkWBennett.
14792263_393191319620698112 x	@MarkWBennett @Popehat I'll ask Kaimi what he's referring to.
14792263_393195044930199552 x	@MarkWBennett @Popehat As do I. No word yet, but I await Kaimi's reply.
14792263_392754765307736066 x	@btannebaum Just wait till they find out you're a hobbit on twitter. @jrushie @mirriam71
14792263_392732204821778432 x	@mirriam71 I heard that you had lunch with @JRushie and @FishtownLawyer yesterday. They said you were adorable. Is that true?
14792263_392733601449533440 x	@mirriam71 Well, I didn't think @JRushie @FishtownLawyer would lie about having lunch, you know. So you're saying they did?
14792263_392735558838927360 x	@mirriam71 My memory isn't what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure @JRushie called you adorable. And shorter than him.
14792263_392736161606549504 x	@mirriam71 @JRushie @btannebaum @Jteisele I'm sure there are other reasons for your populairty. Probably because you're so adorable.
14792263_392737177164992512 x	@mirriam71 @JRushie @btannebaum @Jteisele Well sure. Everyone knows how much guys appreciate keen listening skills & empathy.  And bourbon.
14792263_388736368941072384 x	So @KymeshiaMorris, I have a few posts. Think I could sell them to you for resale? What do you pay for posts?
14792263_388346210886488064 x	Less than a year old, I had to replace my laptop's keyboard b/c it wore out. But Dell sent a new one, though I have to install it myself.
14792263_386125899306762240 x	@iwelsh @bmaz It appears he never asked anyone, but went first for a pop gun rather than a big gun.
14792263_386127200484749312 x	@iwelsh @bmaz Is it always about some foundation or cause group? Does anyone have any duty to think and handle their own affairs anymore?
14792263_386128110833246208 x	@iwelsh @bmaz Of course. There is always some white knight to save people and release people from managing their lives.
14792263_386129074667540480 x	@iwelsh @bmaz The experts? What a nice, simple world you enjoy.
14792263_383234105615187968 x	Remember when @ABAJournal had @WhatAboutParis and me write an article on mentoring, which they later dropped? If only I mentioned iPads.
14792263_382175550321590273 x	What practicing lawyer would go to a conference run by @Clio? Be careful how you answer.
14792263_382190081773010946 x	@njAtty @JRushie @goclio So how much did they pay you to go?
14792263_382178921120145408 x	@JRushie @clio TANSSAAFL.
14792263_382180119160160257 x	@gideonstrumpet @JRushie @clio I'm sure you can pay online.
14792263_381112056994201601 x	.@victormedina So when should I start putting together my keynote for #MILOfest?  @JRushie invited me after @btannebaum turned it down.
14792263_381117164305936384 x	@victormedina @JRushie @btannebaum I have the prototype of the iPhone 4Q. I can't wait to tell the story of how I acquired at my keynote.
14792263_381118232670650368 x	@victormedina @JRushie @btannebaum Perfect. Awaiting first class airplane tickets to New Jersey. It is in NJ, right?
14792263_381159365815701504 x	@JRushie @victormedina See? This is why @btannebaum was never right to give the #MILOfest keynote. I was always the best choice.
14792263_378637571812642816 x	How does someone give a CLE on starting a successful solo practice when they've only been in practice a year?
14792263_377043999753654273 x	Is there a rule that technology inevitably evolves to the point of failure?
14792263_375747699007447042 x	Just got an email from @GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving who says I'm courageous. Wants to know what I think of GD. I should tell him, right?
14792263_372790508122173441 x	Just checked back at my law school Reddit AMA and it looks like things petered out. Guess they got it covered. http://t.co/MQIWjDkwui
14792263_372099479949697025 x	@VBalasubramani I figured you would be a Legal Rebel for sure. You would look so cool holding a Legal Rebel flag wearing red high tops.
14792263_372103870219943936 x	@JRushie @gideonstrumpet @VBalasubramani Was that to host pictures of your murse?
14792263_369790813615554560 x	And @A2Hosting is down again. Woo hoo, another day of #fail.
14792263_368396377077735424 x	@DavidSug It gets lonely up in Oregon. Very lonely. Kinda like Philly for short guys. @JRushie
