20225770_396446866843631616 x	There?s something to be said for giving a shit. That?s all I?m saying. Tonight is embarrassing on all levels.
20225770_396445806561337344 x	I?m generally against this shit, but you know what? Better than putting their tails between their legs.
20225770_393537381401624576 x	Seeing a lot of people say ?Pouliot didn?t mean to do that? ? of course not, but that doesn?t make a hit from behind acceptable.

20225770_393524989573726208 x	Of course, the impossible is always possible with the Flyers this year.
20225770_393539761048416256 x	All things considered, I?d be satisfied with no suspension on the Pouliot hit. A five and a game is suitable I think.
20225770_393401251997941760 x	Typo, sorry about that. Giroux is centering Raffl and Vinny. RT @bbrbrts: @BroadStHockey Wait, G's on the wing?
