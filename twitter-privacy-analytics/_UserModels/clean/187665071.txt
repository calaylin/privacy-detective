187665071_394475906414047232 x	My column on the bond between #Eagles coach Bill McGovern & #NYG LB & cancer survivor Mark Herzlich: http://t.co/3lyK4YKSKv @BostonCollege
187665071_390289025116164097 x	Craig Berube is not the problem. The #Flyers might be playing as well as they can. That's the problem.
187665071_387712686177284096 x	Here at the Wells Fargo Center to write a column off tonight's #Flyers game. Glad they let me in the building. ;)
187665071_394526409479032833 x	PHILADELPHIA -- Ibid. For details, see last week's game. #Eagles
187665071_391176595022438403 x	My column on Claude Giroux, Sidney Crosby, and the gap between 2 players & 2 franchises: http://t.co/z8VuDkdz33 #Flyers #Penguins #NHL
187665071_396433113251078144 x	In 2010, the #Flyers needed a goalie. Three years later, they need everything but.
187665071_395984597067894784 x	Look at Steven Stamkos's career stats. The idea that Steve Downie "created space" for him--& will for Giroux--is absurd on its face. #Flyers
187665071_394272126100058113 x	Four goals for the #Flyers tonight. Imagine how many they'd have if Tye McGinn were still playing for them.
187665071_327433995958771715 x	Hearing teams will draft players, make trades. #NFL
187665071_400080122000056320 x	Note to self: Do not joke about Philadelphia sports on Twitter. Ever. Philadelphia sports are not joking matters. Ever.
187665071_386937597722755072 x	Henery hits his 5th FG of the day. Three more, and you can cue the Herman's Hermits. #Eagles #PeterNooneForever
