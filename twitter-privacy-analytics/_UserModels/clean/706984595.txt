706984595_388404148842291200 x	@RealGlenMacnow he lit it up at first in Columbus. Might be a real bright spot on this team, until Homer trades him for a 2 round pick...
706984595_388309707838226432 x	@Capt_KeepItReal @Eagles @DeseanJackson10 horrible spulling.
706984595_388309463134134272 x	@MikeandIke94WIP @SportsRadioWIP Joe Jurevicius.  Or Bryant for that stupid 65 yard field goal at the end of the game in 2008.
706984595_388120600117780480 x	@SunGarrioch was with the Flyers for 1 year right? He will be working for the team soon enough.
706984595_388120324652687360 x	@darealtank78 Why can't this team find a replacement for Cooper? He has shown nothing this season.
706984595_388111237386887168 x	RT @bobfordsports: Twitter is very dangerous this week.
706984595_388109505747484672 x	@KirkHerbstreit i'd say Matt Stairs is closer than Horrey
706984595_388069746757095425 x	@KevinCooney you're opinions on the org. hold water, but to criticize a loyal fan base makes no sense.
706984595_388072047437705216 x	@KevinCooney I'm not talking about the piece, I'm talking about the criticism that fans are drinking kool-aid. Fans are venting frustration.
706984595_388075159988731904 x	@KevinCooney diff. is Flyers fans do not have an outlet because hockey doesn't "move the needle" so I think the overly loyal rap is flawed.
706984595_388076315578220544 x	@KevinCooney the same points u made in you're work, fans are talking about. Its a small irrational minority that attack the media.
706984595_388085968240390144 x	@KevinCooney how did it feel arguing with a Star Wars character for 20 minutes?
706984595_388102439142170624 x	@KevinCooney pretty rational for a squid.
706984595_388095793586274304 x	@TheRealDGunnCSN you should change your last name to pistol.
706984595_388085661557096448 x	@JennaLaineBucs @GeoffMosherCSN this whole thing is out of context and overblown. Media fodder for a lazy Sunday broadcast.
706984595_388081432654254082 x	@RealGlenMacnow @Ricksg35 its not the move, its the fact that a 19 y/o rookie did it in an NHL game. This ain't the Sun beer league, chum.
706984595_388081159793807361 x	@RealGlenMacnow I hate STL, but I think I hate pittsburgh more just because of the Penguins. Not sure which is lesser of two evils.
706984595_388078530460131328 x	@Capt_KeepItReal boxing has been dead for years. I can't get into either sport tho.
706984595_388077776278151168 x	@KevinCooney i appreciate the dialogue,  i just feel the fan-rep from inside the city is as bad as the "boo-bird" rep outside the city.
706984595_388077107852869632 x	@KevinCooney It is not about you're one tweet. I am talking about the general perception of a fan base that is based in the small minority.
706984595_388074874776076288 x	@KevinCooney other teams in this city have loyal fans, that vent on their teams and still buy team merch and show up to games.
706984595_388075775821631488 x	@KevinCooney i think that is a small minority of fans, same as the "snowballs at santa claus" rep that isn't accurate. (More)
706984595_388074666474348545 x	@KevinCooney I think you're missing my point. I'm not saying it is you're job. But Flyers fans always get criticized for loyal to a fault...
706984595_388074441277984770 x	@KevinCooney but the fan base was hopeful, and now frustrated 4 games into an 82 game season.
706984595_388073918139211776 x	@KevinCooney I'm not arguing your point on the team. I agree, the scouting and front office hold the blame. Bryz move set team back years...
706984595_388067932586393600 x	@RoobCSN I'd take that kid Woods tho. A lot of upside
706984595_388054953056817152 x	@SpikeEskin when they move the Sixers will you please go with them?
706984595_388052833582735360 x	@NASCAR when are you adding right turns to the sport? Or is that too controversial?
706984595_388051739305598977 x	@hater_ex @Capt_KeepItReal @RealGlenMacnow Rob Ellis ain't to shabby.
706984595_388050783083978752 x	@howardeskin since when do you watch hockey?
706984595_388049794297765888 x	@RealGlenMacnow what is it going to take for Flyers to realize they overpay mid level talent. No cap space. Bad roster. #annoyed
706984595_388049306378579968 x	@Capt_KeepItReal sounds #annoying
706984595_388049186362753024 x	@SpikeEskin the whole "flyers card" thing is over blown, Spike. Quit taking tips from your hack of a father. #annoyed filter:news
