314654580_398560032955981824 x	@EziosVengeance yes but that costs you a 1st round pick for a average pitcher. You need more elite level players not average players
314654580_398561159902552064 x	@EziosVengeance Tanaka will cost in total about 100 million...only a numpty would take him over Price
314654580_398562234801999872 x	@EziosVengeance none of those players will end up being as good as Price
314654580_398563142357098496 x	@EziosVengeance Hamels is not an ace
