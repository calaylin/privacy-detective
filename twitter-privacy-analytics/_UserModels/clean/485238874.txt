485238874_393088895434637312 x	Terrible comparison
485238874_392375995246063616 x	@TonyBrunoShow maybe you should focus more energy on reading injury reports.  Justin Blackmon and Cecil shorts comt was as competent as IRS
485238874_392377567745175553 x	@TonyBrunoShow well your honest, real, and can take a shot.  Love the show
485238874_391243495148888064 x	@BroadStBull maybe they just aren't good.  The squeezing sticks excuse is getting old

485238874_388347575624941568 x	@RealSkipBayless  Only you could make Stephen A. look kindhearted.  ESPN needs to get Richard Sherman back on your show.
485238874_388040993662320640 x	@KirkHerbstreit is a 10-2 ND a legit BCS bowl team in your eyes?  Assuming a 1 loss Stan team at end of year
485238874_388035404261498881 x	@RSherman_25 you should be thanked each day for going at Skip Bayless.  He is paid to hate on NFL players non stop.  Well done sir
485238874_388025915856666624 x	@tpanotchCSN is there anything flyer beat writers don't complain about. At least I get to read about your whining on @CrossingBroad daily
485238874_388021774472200192 x	@NYTimeskrugman  time to bring out your line from "Return of Depression Economics" regarding buying treasuries and stocking up on water
485238874_388017506491064320 x	@Matt_Fortuna what with the Greg Bryant transfer rumors?
485238874_388019607996747776 x	@Matt_Fortuna let's hope, seems to happen every year now days.  Each time there was smoke and sadly a fire

485238874_385861455780003841 x	@JayBilas I am guessing Ha ha Clinton Dix isn't to blame for this?
485238874_385495098777436162 x	@schadjoe kids do that in backyards for generations.  Only in this society do we question it.  What a joke
485238874_385494953201532928 x	@schadjoe builds character and toughness.  Great tool to also bring a group together
485238874_383584782783090688 x	@ESPN_Colin one could argue Manziel benefits from Sumlin system to a degree as well. Look at the numbers his QBs put up over the years
485238874_382597633728327680 x	@GSCareers do you guys ever actually review the online applications?  I mean honestly
485238874_382596085107392512 x	@ESPN_Colin sadly you are somehow always right when bashing my Notre Dame.  I use your opinion on them to bet each game to hedge my emotions

485238874_381805631067684865 x	@Espngreeny the marketing exposure players like Manziel get are more than enough "compensation"
485238874_381767958067810307 x	@JayBilas Wish someone paid for all my books, education, and provided top notch tutoring at my convenience.  Poor NCAA athletes.
485238874_381790555052576768 x	@JayBilas Your right some do suffer because their market value is not reached.  What about the others who are essentally a deadweight loss
