116197194_396302923333775361 x	@ryanlawrence21 im a big trout fan. had two amzing seasons. to say its not even close is absurd. Migman will go down as one of the best ever
116197194_396305145954189312 x	@ryanlawrence21 ignoring the fact that miggy has been doing it for 12yrs. Could possibly play for another 10 years. http://t.co/m2hAbFkWgE
116197194_396310318021742592 x	@ryanlawrence21 when talking abt GOAT fielding and running is secondary. View mig in historical sense #williams #ruth #mantle #bonds #aaron
116197194_396311952542027776 x	@ryanlawrence21 if mays didnt have the hitting numbers he had he would not be listed among the best. By that logic Ricky Henderson in top 5?
116197194_396313602459570176 x	@ryanlawrence21 so a guy who could be compared with some of the best players all time is not the best in baseball right now?
116197194_396315252729475072 x	@ryanlawrence21 bc you can't defend you argument. its all good. this banter took me all the way to lunch. see what your started @jachobe lol
