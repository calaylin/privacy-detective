1631034488_390295930760867840 x	Getting a lot of breaking bad tweets today. I don't really mind it but when u say it's the best show ever made. It's a mistake #ohhkillem
1631034488_390296503644090369 x	@antgeezyy your one of those AMC fags that won't let it down. Watch The Wire on HBO then talk to me
1631034488_390297051134963712 x	@antgeezyy yeah? And u saw all of it? And u don't claim it's the best written show ever made? I don't even wanna talk to u right now
1631034488_390297852851007488 x	@antgeezyy lmao right? And the first half of the last season of breaking bad wasn't weak? Please.
1631034488_390298666210451456 x	@antgeezyy if u saw the wire. You can't sit there and say breaking bad is better
