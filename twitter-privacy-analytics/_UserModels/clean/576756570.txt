576756570_394830074785964033 x	@NHLFlyersWriter @FlyGoalScoredBy Coots. Especially with the Flyers depth at center
576756570_394832064572186624 x	@NHLFlyersWriter You prefer Coots over Schenn? Why?
576756570_394832829432881153 x	@NHLFlyersWriter I agree that he's good defensively, I see that point. I feel like Brayden has more of an upside offensively but idk
