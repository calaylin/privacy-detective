153230952_394300934886416385 x	@dynasty8314 @SeanMcDermott14 @ShannonSharpe why would Bucs go QB with rookie Glennon there?
153230952_394302068808097792 x	@SeanMcDermott14 @dynasty8314 @ShannonSharpe mar iota is a system QB. Better get Murray or bridgewater. Manziel to sell tix.
153230952_394302792812072961 x	@dynasty8314 @SeanMcDermott14 @ShannonSharpe news flash. That offense ain't working. You're not playing barely out of high school kids
153230952_394301439008194560 x	@dynasty8314 @SeanMcDermott14 @ShannonSharpe false. You don't get a rookie to back him up the next year with a rookie. That's bad drafting
