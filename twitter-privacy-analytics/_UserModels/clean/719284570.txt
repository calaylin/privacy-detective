719284570_395951451132157952 x	@jmac_18 you can tell a joke in Philly, people will just throw pumpkins at you. Hope you've been keeping your hands sharp!
719284570_395948588708429824 x	@Ike58Reese I wanted to dress up as an Eagles WR. But I didn't get a costume because some kid jammed me @ the door and I couldn't get by him
719284570_395923432992686080 x	@TonyBrunoShow the 76ers bandwagon took on so many people last night, it is threatening to capsize like a North African migrant boat.
719284570_395701104761401344 x	RT @NBA: RT @Sixers: #Sixers announce that they will hold retirement ceremony for @alleniverson Mar. 1, 2014 during @WashWizards game
719284570_395697705382871040 x	@SpikeEskin "did you like your toilets swirling backwards? Cause you're on the next flight back to Sydney!"
719284570_395697146600906752 x	@SpikeEskin We are gonna win this one boss!!!
719284570_395201954856849409 x	@TonyBrunoShow tony on a duck boat? That's like captain stabbin giving tours of the battleship New Jersey
719284570_394179365766184960 x	@36westbrook @nk975 something's got to give! Let's hope Vick knows the rules, that the game CAN end in a tie.
719284570_393386663378157568 x	@tonybrunoshow @harrymayes975 I'd trade Shady without a second thought. What good is a 1000+ yd RB if you don't have a QB that can win?
719284570_393379716369227776 x	@TonyBrunoShow Favre can't play with the same kind of heart he once did. He's too busy wearing wranglers. And snapchating pics of his junk.
719284570_393378985851486208 x	@NK975 He won't  be able to play with the same kind of heart he once did. He's too busy wearing wranglers. And snapchating pics of his junk.
719284570_393080289385541632 x	@975TheFanatic @mikemiss975 I love Shady but he's not getting younger,  and QB is the most important pos in all sports.
719284570_393079384586080257 x	@975TheFanatic @mikemiss975 done and done. What good is having a 1000+ yd RB when you don't have a QB that can win? I wouldn't think twice.
719284570_393077653714251776 x	@philmcnulty RVP and Rooney can score in international matches, why not for Man U?
719284570_393073078877818880 x	@JonandSeanShow if you could trade the entire Eagles roster for the Chiefs, ONLY if Andy Reid came with them, would you?
719284570_393016329940525057 x	@JoeYounes975 which number will be greater; the number of wins the Flyers have or the number of goals Giroux will score?
719284570_393012314133499905 x	@HARRYMAYES975 @975thefanatic Barkley. Vick is a known quantity, and I don't think Foles is the answer. Might as well see what he's got.
719284570_392674533930713088 x	@TonyBrunoShow @ken_j_ab go ahead hater! Go put NPR back on if you don't like what u hear!
719284570_393011065845710848 x	@Ken_J_Ab @tonybrunoshow @harrymayes975 what do u want him to spit sabermetrics for 2 hrs? They're just opinions. Don't hate, appreciate!
719284570_392996993712521216 x	@WIPMorningShow Dave Montgomery. I think he made a deal with the Devil to win in '08. Now we will go winless as a city for the next 100 yrs.
719284570_392713451912835073 x	@DanielMcNulty10 @tonybrunoshow that was directed at him. At least your opinions are original. Not regurgitated garbage like others spew..
719284570_392642015718309888 x	@ill_adelphia dan I didn't see that link u tweeted me til jus now... That sucks! He was cool as hell.
719284570_392620803227127808 x	@MikeMiss975 Mike Greenberg and Chris Carter owe you some royalties due to their use of "google me" this morning.
719284570_392513480513048576 x	@NFLONFOX are you sure that isn't Nick Foles's stat sheet?
719284570_392513138949881856 x	@nfl @giants keep winning! We don't want you getting the top pick!
719284570_392457029962706944 x	@SportsRadioWIP what a dirtball. Probably just went to the game for the party, and got waaaay too wasted. Hope his "boys" snitch him out.
719284570_392456183220826112 x	@DerekBodnerNBA @sportsradiowip exactly. We hear about snowballs and Santa 40 odd years later. Kind of silly compared to something like this
719284570_392455280942129152 x	RT @Cindy610: @SpikeEskin better watch these tweets #99problems  ??
719284570_392306780405264384 x	@TonyBrunoShow Nick Foles played so badly yesterday that even my Pitt Bull wants Mike Vick back in the lineup.
719284570_391766488748929024 x	@Darickman It's kind of like saying "yeah I love my wife..... But I wish she had her sisters face."
719284570_391766161060536320 x	@Darickman Most Cowboy fans in Phill are Flyers, Phillies and 76ers fans too. I just don't get it.
719284570_391765376809590784 x	@Darickman I grew up a birds fan because I am proud of the region, it's history, it's people, it's identity. all of it.
719284570_391757102026596352 x	@Darickman it's simple. We hate the Cowboys because of their success, and that hate is intensified because of their fraud fans from Philly.
719284570_391181193720651776 x	@brucehallsports @profootballtalk yeah Washington D.C. area is a paradise! Don't take your inferiority complex out on Philly.

719284570_390904266707468288 x	@Espngreeny agreed. In Game 1 of the 2001 finals he dazzled. He out played Shaq AND Kobe that night! Sucks they had to play four more games
719284570_390894049907195904 x	@SportsCenter @chris_broussard We talkin' bout retirement. Not a game, retirement. Not the game I go out and die for every day, retirement.
719284570_390877982128345088 x	@JonandSeanShow @jonmarks975 why would the Raiders consider that trade? Foles isn't overrated enough for them!
719284570_390870825643282433 x	@ill_adelphia I used to live in Round Rock and got PLENTY of hate! Say hi to Leslie for me!
