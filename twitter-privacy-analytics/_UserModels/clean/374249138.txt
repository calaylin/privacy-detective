374249138_392018725018566656 x	Barkley's special. Not many QBs can come into this league and throw TWO int's on one drive.

374249138_394553306548547584 x	Good God, was that a miserable experience or what??
374249138_389479774147842048 x	Not a dazzler, but Foles deserves to get the start next week against Dallas. Decent win for the boys.
374249138_331134322826428416 x	The Islanders and Wild are in the playoffs and the Flyers arent? That's re-dic.
374249138_391986084995149824 x	The Eagles keep running the read option. Who in hell thinks foles is gonna keep?
374249138_393119326838202368 x	@jragone88 Aw, i offended a Pearl Jam cultist!
374249138_390626364665372672 x	Doesnt TBS know: a) how bad ernie johnson is play by play? b) how dreadful their post game show is? Yikes

374249138_390648971036995584 x	Hey Shane, nice beard. Its a football beard. 11 on each side
374249138_389472180565979136 x	Is it me, or is this one of the most boring eagles games ever?
374249138_345643651168358401 x	Everybody got out safe. Thx for caring folks
374249138_394548561398231041 x	Wow, this team has COMPLETELY lost their home crowd

374249138_386906276804177920 x	Eagles just dont look PREPARED. Penalty. Drop. No offensive sizzle. Hate to say: Thats on the coach
374249138_394517938143002624 x	Just saw Vick grab at his hamstring. Guarantee Barkley plays today. Ugh
374249138_320981370564395008 x	Phils post game show with larry bowa and me sfter game. Larry not liking that hamels pitched with extra day rest.
374249138_361279299657023488 x	There is nobody at triple-a who could have gotten a spot start? Why not?
374249138_394520110175911936 x	Great story on hillis and walking to get pizza. What?? Sure, no pizza joints in n. jersey would deliver to a hotel

374249138_384449161699278848 x	This is a horrendous and heartless defensive effort. Chip, you've got no fighters. Worse than i ever could have imagined. G'nite.
374249138_390605381883682816 x	@hhandb College is diff criteria

374249138_377231132150214657 x	Wasnt Gruden on the record as NOT being a proponent of chip offense? Chucky now slobbering
374249138_351059440264429568 x	Just visited with our buddy Dutch. He looks good and is in good spirits, determined to beat this. Help him with good vibes
374249138_331175207572230146 x	Did Halladay say he'a hurt out of the embarrassment of this outing? Why in the past does everyone, incl him, say he's healthy? #juswondering
374249138_374308370876219392 x	PR the Great has announced he's recorded a new jam to be the open to the Mike Missanelli Show! We'll unveil this coming week.
374249138_376908961880219648 x	Is chris christie out if his freakin mind? Machismo is fine, unless its ridiculously stupid.
374249138_366260253261705217 x	Brace bailed of a taping of Philly Pheud this monday for a softball game. Violation? So now who should be his replacement?

374249138_285459523249000449 x	Football writer, pat kirwan, put colt anderson in his group of eagles young core. Geesh. And u wonder why we bitch about "national medua"
374249138_391942689236987904 x	@BaseballJorge I wouldnt have signed him either
374249138_316014053849985024 x	What lasalle is doing is one of the most amazing philly college hoop stories ever. Six players only, five of them guards. Tough.
374249138_397124921899229184 x	I was afraid this might happen. Foles looking good in A game is gonna convince the fan base they have a QB. Ugh
374249138_267760391487123458 x	Best case scenario for eagles . They now can play foles without actually having to bench vick
374249138_398633571960635392 x	Flyers fans: how you feeling about a "fresh perspective?"
374249138_394543701261029377 x	Chip doesnt look like he has instincts. Fourth an 8 easier to convert than 50 yd FG? Passing at the 2? Read option with barkley? Puzzling

374249138_394305894617739264 x	I told everybody that Penn State would hold ohio state UNDER 700 yards. I was right!
374249138_396815994665975808 x	This Sixer thing has to be one of the most of the amazing things ive seen in philly sports in a long time
374249138_396795831237742592 x	I was one day out of whack in picking against the Sixers. I blame it on daylight savings time
374249138_306595993850351616 x	Collins just threw his team under the bus for not playing hard. The coach has no bearing on that? R players no longer listening to him?
374249138_400463447970029568 x	@NXML129 Too bad u missed Julius Randle in the first game tonight bro
374249138_397118264242737152 x	A defensive back who gets beat to the end zone by Riley Cooper should be immediately demoted to the practice squad
374249138_399713813572124672 x	@Meginississippi Oh yeah, he's great.
374249138_399717317959225344 x	@MarkMarozzi Oh u mean cooper? Please...

374249138_397931480858365953 x	Wow, a young katherine heigl co-starring with Seagal. Under Siege II!
374249138_394521169904553984 x	Is that Giants TE kidding me not knowing where the backline was? God these 2 teams stink
374249138_392078335175843840 x	Whats up with Tom jackson moaning affirmation every time someone on that panel says something. We in a Pentecostal church?
374249138_389465165441560577 x	Now we know anyone with MRSA cant cover a slow white receiver. Can jonathan banks have any street cred after that? Geesh
374249138_377219606303477761 x	Im exhausted WATCHING this game!
374249138_357334270009815041 x	Please tell me mccarver just didnt spit a Sandman line! Awk-ward.
374249138_336299722727895040 x	Billboard music awards. Miguel. You gettin sued bro.
374249138_287732684992692224 x	Before he made that ridiculously stupid bail out throw, i was thinkin that maybe joe webb was a QB fit for chip kelly with the eagles.
374249138_272748760612884480 x	Glad today that all you phony ND fans with no connection to the school can gloat. Go IRISH.
374249138_267803317130915840 x	Is it just me, or is anyone else think its a douche move for a player in tv intros to give his high school, middle school or jr high?
374249138_399679323248271360 x	@FrankWibble215 Uh...ratings? Haha. Why dont u apply for my job?
374249138_397143561759510528 x	Right now, most of u think the franchise QB is here already. As Nathan R Jessup said: Take caution in your tone.
374249138_394528601003266048 x	Matty Ice!! Hahaha
374249138_395693796790259712 x	Who would be dumb enough to bet a million on the money line on the Heat?? Haha
374249138_382293385014677506 x	Halladay with "arm fatigue?" You mean the arm was fine through his bullpen warm up?
374249138_372881866917183488 x	Jimmy drove in that run, but it wont dawn on him what a horrendously bad play he made there getting thrown out at 3B
374249138_395722849035362304 x	This might be the biggest outright upset of all time. Wow! Credit to the Sixers. I wouldnt have called that in a million years
374249138_395360418228867072 x	Uh oh, scratch the Bulls off as Heat challenger in east. Up to you Pacers. 21-pt halftime lead. I puttin a million on 2mrw nite money line

374249138_392011137086406656 x	Well, that non throw to Avant tells the tale of today for Nicky
374249138_391995886051807232 x	DeSean, after foles doesnt throw that deep ball in bounds: "Yo man, where Mike at?!"
374249138_389807812941201408 x	@MrBEEnPhilly uh oh. U feelin protective of 7? Must be
374249138_389464304577445888 x	How Riley Cooper beats ANYBODY on a fly pattern is a bigger mystery than the DaVinci Code.
374249138_384441446541316096 x	They run that pick route with Welker ALL THE TIME. Anticipate it! Good God!
374249138_380873486220398592 x	Cant believe how perfect that was for Eagles fans at end of half. Oh...Andy!!
374249138_392007236127842304 x	Why cant they get the ball to their TE's today? C'mon chip...
