37687716_312590592020467712 x	@RoobCSN i know its a different regime but it would seem saddening to return to a place where a member of Eagles family passed.
37687716_306149026213015552 x	@GeoffMosherCSN Eagles should've drafted Logan Mankins and Vincent Jackson instead of Patterson and Reggie Brown.
37687716_306148544597856256 x	@LesBowen could you consider him a 1st rd disappointment?  Eagles should have drafted L Makins and/or Vincent Jackson.  Both needs at time
