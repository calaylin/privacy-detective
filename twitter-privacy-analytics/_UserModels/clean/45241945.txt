45241945_366190302236655616 x	Zach Ertz misses blocks/assignments (I think) on first two snaps for Eagles. Probably would've been big runs if he fits up

45241945_423670735979429888 x	@bomani_jones Peter Russo really was a great character. His plotline was probably my favorite part of season 1
45241945_423671618817511424 x	@Adam_Jacobi @bomani_jones right. Lots of stuff in the rest of the show didn't exactly hold together, but his stuff totally worked (for me)
