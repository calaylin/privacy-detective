146566907_384448989963096064 x	Let's do remember that Peyton put up 49 on the Ravens. Denver's offense is playing at an elite all-time level right now.
146566907_299935159443140609 x	Chip Kelly, Billy Davis, and lots of scheme talk. Studied some Cards games to get a feel for the #Eagles new scheme.  http://t.co/5Knp5LJF
146566907_288022986307559424 x	Anquan Boldin and Reno Mahe were both WRs at the 2003 Combine. Mahe ran a 4.68. Boldin ran 4.72. Crazy, huh? Boldin was 20 lbs heavier.
146566907_283216889218482176 x	Mr @Syvertsen_D  has a bowl preview up for tonight's Fresno St / SMU game. The big star is Safety Phillip Thomas.   http://t.co/Tv5ajAQu
146566907_269936712489238528 x	@WCrill  Mark Simoneau was the LB who kicked for us in 2005. And Mark over Johnny as a PK for sure.
146566907_269924539276873728 x	Funny to see rain coming down at USC-UCLA.The players act like they're in a monsoon or something like that. Cali don't know nothin bout rain
146566907_254395477561331712 x	@WCrill  Give yourself a gold star sir. I'd offer @Jimmy_Beast 's autograph, but that is totally worthless.
146566907_247491945625169920 x	@WCrill  I would probably say Jason Peters is the best acquisition in recent years, but DeMeco comes right after that.
146566907_245280039178993665 x	Vick yesterday: 29-56-317 w/ 2 TDs, 4 INTs. McNabb in CIN tie 2008: 28-58-339 w/ 1 TD, 3 INTs. McNabb almost got us to SB later that year.
146566907_393953885372440576 x	Way late, but here is my review of the Eagles loss to Dallas from last week.  http://t.co/EDkTCk8McW
146566907_388500554772525056 x	My prediction...Giants cross midfield and then Eli throws a pick.
146566907_280880921710825472 x	@RoobCSN  Why would he do that when Glenn Foley is ready to go all Glenn Foley on this game?
146566907_280881679244095490 x	@RoobCSN  I have no idea. I do remember that Tony Bruno was pretty sure Foley would be the next Joe Montana. Almost came true.
146566907_388493517208567809 x	The good news for the Giants is that they just cut the deficit to 6. The bad news? They're awful in the 4th Qtr, which is about to start.
146566907_392868696147775488 x	The #Eagles defense is showing some progress. Not as much as we want, but some.  http://t.co/Dwfgiw1mx4
146566907_391964665120452608 x	Wonder if Eagles having 6 WRs and 3 TEs active means the team is going to go really up tempo today. Could wear down thin Dallas D.
146566907_387407594190426112 x	This Jets front seven is fun to watch. So good.
146566907_384440418449911809 x	Fletcher Cox has been too quiet in this game. And has at least one penalty. Need him to step up.
146566907_371460988010131456 x	If only the Eagles had Nick Foles leading the late drives in the Super Bowl, we might have won. Master of the hurry-up and totally clutch.
146566907_371455208502468608 x	Great drive by Nick Foles and the backup offense. Good to see WR Russell Shepard making some plays.
146566907_371446419665588225 x	Bryce Brown looked great on that drive...until the fumble. Stop me if you've heard that before.
146566907_370716507153518592 x	I thought the Super Bowl jinx happened to the teams that lost the game. What the heck is going on with Joe Flacco and the Ravens?
146566907_384451926542135296 x	Things could always be worse. We could be the Giants.
146566907_386937510065995776 x	I just don't see how Eli Manning can expect to win a shootout against Alex Henery.
146566907_389472528214663170 x	I was hoping for a pick-6, but forcing a FG is good enough for now. Shocked that Tampa drove that ball 90 yds down the field.
146566907_379915674681745409 x	@turkdaddydollar @RavensInsider There aren't any good Safeties available. The whole NFC East needs Safety help.
146566907_380775945361059840 x	@KCraigLTMR I doubt it. Likely inactive. Hope I'm wrong.
146566907_397136168824737792 x	My conclusion from today...Isaaco Sopoaga was holding back the offense.
