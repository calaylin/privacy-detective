1864910491_392072266097655809 x	@nbarone007 @Winless4Wiggins Yes, I understand that. We are 1 win away from last year's win total under Reid. That says something.
1864910491_392073756132507648 x	@nbarone007 @Winless4Wiggins I'm just saying if you look deeper into their record (who they played), you can understand why they're winning.

1864910491_392075095961006080 x	@HungryJack215 @Winless4Wiggins Why? They're winning due to a weak schedule, good defense (Not Andy's side of the ball).
1864910491_392073963456966656 x	@amitj113 @Winless4Wiggins Yes, and it would be deserved. You have to beat those teams. Simple as that.
