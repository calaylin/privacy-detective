517089486_423203869800161280 x	@Damon089 @blakejud Kelly/Foles always gave more credit to Lazor than others. I'm not on team, so I don't know, but seems like he was big.
517089486_423204876219211776 x	@Damon089 @blakejud You mean the same Pat Shurmur who completely failed with Colt McCoy AND Brandon Weeden?
517089486_423206361405485056 x	@Damon089 @FallenHero32 @Philatticus @blakejud What's that supposed to imply? I'm just saying the truth: losing Lazor hurts.
517089486_423207545868525568 x	@Philatticus @FallenHero32 @Damon089 @blakejud We'll see. I just valued Lazor > Shurmur because that's who Foles/Chip were always crediting
517089486_423207795006001152 x	@Philatticus @FallenHero32 @Damon089 @blakejud We know what he needs: talent around him and improved presence under pressure.
