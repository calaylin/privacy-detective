488011724_387169806589259776 x	Name the last individual player, in any sport, you were more entertained watching than Peyton Manning right now. #MikeAndMike
488011724_387170562952282112 x	Good question posed by my friend @themmqb: Would you want an 11:35 game every week? #MikeAndMike
488011724_348805710395613187 x	But... The fact is I have to think about it a minute when you ask "Michael or Lebron?" That says a lot. And someday, my answer might change.
488011724_348805694180433921 x	Michael Jordan is the greatest player I've ever seen in any sport. That has not changed. But... (cont)
488011724_348026418829078528 x	Let the haters hate. You can't do more than Lebron has done. He's as good as anyone ever. #Heat
488011724_346409853452951552 x	Phil just couldn't make a putt today. Had his chances. 16 in particular was a killer. #usopen
488011724_390897969014509568 x	Pound for pound, there wasn't a tougher player than Allen Iverson. At his best, as electric to watch as just about anybody ever.
488011724_389830342729031681 x	I'm just guessing Steve Bartman isn't overly worried about Matt Schaub's feelings today. #TenYears
488011724_379556996430585857 x	The #Eagles HAD to run the clock down before they kicked that FG. To say "that's not what we do" is ridiculous.
488011724_319989693645205505 x	Wonderful crowd in Dallas, thanks all who came. Pitt tomorrow, 5 signings across Midwest this weekend, details here: http://t.co/I9S52hANTC.
488011724_385358349388103680 x	I'm torn on how I feel about a one game series. It's exciting, but feels a tad unsatisfying. Your thoughts? #MikeAndMike
488011724_377200610405519360 x	#KOD picks from this morning... #Eagles with the points, straight up win... #Texans cover at San Diego...
488011724_335120757740957696 x	Keegan Bradley shot 60 today. Complete this sentence:  I would give up ______ to do that just once in my life.
488011724_319778441530580992 x	2 words. Beat. Down. ?@MikeAndMike Greeny grabbed some air during book interviews. Best captions on air! http://t.co/6JDqA9wYhq
488011724_293095236467585024 x	Niners offense looks clunky, Kaepernick looks anxious.
488011724_286509762194063360 x	Again, I don't like #Eagles job. Pressure to win immediately immense. Those pieces don't fit together, it's a dangerous job for young coach.
488011724_390450813446799360 x	With our thanks to all who supported our book, Stacy and I today are donating $100,000 to The V Foundation in honor of our friend Heidi.
488011724_381803271725543424 x	I fully support and admire the #APU players. They show courage and maturity, and they're 100% in the right.
488011724_287719606062288896 x	That was one of the worst NFL playoff games ever. Happy for #TEXANS,  but my guess is Tom Brady isn't shivering with fear.
488011724_378494990399205376 x	Ron Jaworski agrees: #Jets playcalling was inexplicable. This loss is on the head coach of the offense, Marty Mornhinweg.
488011724_372832314759593984 x	Johnny Manziel suspended for half a game. Just think about that for a minute. It may be the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. #Aggies
488011724_330864446702485504 x	In the discussion of best big men in the NBA, not sure where Joakim Noah belongs, but we made a mistake not mentioning his name. #Bulls
488011724_287754643361128449 x	Some of us really look forward to these games. What a letdown today has been. Both these games, differently, stunk. #Vikings #Bengals
488011724_264914400199184384 x	That's a touchdown for #USC, and 100 points on the board. #Oregon
488011724_264911064859299840 x	Boy, Aaron Rodgers is in a LOT of commercials all of a sudden...
488011724_378557533075808256 x	Ask him why they threw the ball so much!!!!!!! RT ?@KMart_LI: Rex to join us momentarily on conference call...?
488011724_345179651515219969 x	Defining decision for Erik Spoelstra: Does he dare bench Wade if things stay as they've been? My guess is he doesn't. But should he? #Heat
488011724_386959845674745856 x	Wow. #Peyton
488011724_378463081208102913 x	I put that loss on Marty Mornhinweg. Why on earth are you throwing 35 times w/ rookie QB?  Your WR's can't catch!!! Run the ball!!!  #Jets
488011724_376817510278258688 x	That was a cheap shot by Clay Matthews. That is a BRUTAL job by the officials!!! #Niners #Packers
488011724_364175944778383360 x	There is absolutely no good reason Johnny Manziel shouldn't be allowed to make money signing his name.
488011724_320895925625188352 x	Hated 2 biggest calls of last night. The jump ball in gm 1, charge in gm 2. Both decided games. Both were dead WRONG. #Cuse #WichitaState
488011724_318380096933199873 x	Happy for the fans of Wichita St and Cuse, but by any objective measure, as a fan, those games yesterday absolutely stunk.
488011724_315227645489070080 x	Illinois may have just played the worst ten minutes of basketball you will ever see.
488011724_293846138900054016 x	I'm glad Brady reached out to apologize to Ed Reed. He probably didn't have to, but it was the right thing to do. #Patriots #Ravens
488011724_276781534164422656 x	Youkilis in a #Yankees uniform would be really, really weird...
488011724_275717240685477888 x	Lebron for Sportsman of the Year is a good choice, I think... Who else would you have nominated?
488011724_376703547686916096 x	I was rooting for #Michigan last night, but am I the only one who thought both those pass interference calls were awful? #NotreDame
488011724_293183723837464576 x	Now run it #Ravens. Flacco has done his part, run the clock...
488011724_258889588733530112 x	I definitely believe now that ARod has played his last game as a #Yankees. They are burying him, purposely, on and off the field.
488011724_257189950276128769 x	Did I miss it? Who told the refs in the #Northwestern #Minnesota game that they have to call a penalty on every play? #B1GCats
488011724_281371661746458624 x	Do you have an issue w/ #Cowboys allowing Josh Brent on the sideline? Tell me why, best ones on air... #MikeAndMike
488011724_397761435255578624 x	If the #Dolphins locker room is starting to remind you of the movie "A Few Good Men," you are not alone. #CodeRed
488011724_245835418619232256 x	People piling on #Vick, I get it, bad day. People loving #Flacco, I get it, great night. But this week: #Eagles over #Ravens, write it down.
488011724_288227271687434240 x	For those up early: We're at 12th and Ocean starting at six! Come one, come all! #GolicThong
488011724_301314904693035008 x	If you're listening, answer this question: Why would Clowney play this year? Answers on air... #MikeAndMike
488011724_295877707252776960 x	Why do you watch the Pro Bowl? Best answers on air... #MikeAndMike
488011724_270263908835672065 x	My word, the #Eagles are atrocious...
488011724_267963924853452802 x	The #Eagles have been as interesting as any team the last 15 years. A dramatic & mostly successful era. And, as of yesterday, it is over.
488011724_363381763927982080 x	Bucket list golf today: Played Oakmont Country Club, Pittsburgh. Absolutely sensational. New number one course for me in the US.
488011724_373223026768502784 x	That's better. #Jets
