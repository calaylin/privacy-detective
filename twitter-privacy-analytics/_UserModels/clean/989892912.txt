989892912_398174045927399424 x	@MJDiGeronimo @LibertarianMike Yeah, let's hope not.
989892912_398226351255080960 x	@MJDiGeronimo Explain to how Libertarian views are at all practical. Let's say you remove Govt oversight from everything.....then what?
989892912_398247674563928064 x	@MJDiGeronimo I have never heard a Libertarian who doesn't want to de-fund  all oversight. Question; how would you fund Fire/EMS/Police?
989892912_398434339954098176 x	@MJDiGeronimo Libertarians want to defund offices like, public education, CDC, FDA, USDA, EPA, NSA and so on....horrible idea.
989892912_398497665518170112 x	@MJDiGeronimo Why on earth would you NOT want a true democracy?!? Where PEOPLE get a voice, not money. (Thanks again SCOTUS)
989892912_398555659513659393 x	@MJDiGeronimo So, you'd rather not live in a democracy, is what you're saying?
989892912_398615011943145472 x	@MJDiGeronimo And you don't agree with mine. That's what makes the country great, right? The ability to disagree and debate.
989892912_398799890761125889 x	@MJDiGeronimo Therein lies the problem. Remove regulation & oversight, "reasonable" people cleats to exist. Example: Large banks
989892912_398852599052763136 x	@MJDiGeronimo suppliers and we conspire to raise our prices together instead of competing. Are the consumers STILL the best "regulators"?
989892912_398908179163414528 x	@MJDiGeronimo Wonder if we can find common ground, or at least (gasp)  compromise. What regs would you like to see ended, or weakened?
989892912_398935687409303552 x	@MJDiGeronimo I guess on that one we'll agree to disagree, LOL
989892912_398614811765784576 x	@MJDiGeronimo I did watch, and my guard I always down for good conversation. I just don't agree with your (or Libertarian) views....
