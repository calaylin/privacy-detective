380717134_391997484949463041 x	When does it come to the point that Foles realizes that he is hurting the team being out there obviously injured... let Matt Barkley play
380717134_391996770919530496 x	Why can't we have a dome filled with turf??? Our offense would be unstoppable .... plus we could host superbowls

380717134_391995786260516864 x	Chip has no faith in Foles.... lol I wonder if Barkley comes out and starts the 2nd half ...

380717134_391988888526266368 x	Too much East & West running... we need North & South... that is where the endzones are!!!
380717134_391987778851860480 x	Seems as if they are feeding Randle the ball in hopes of the saftey closing in the box to attempt play action bomb!
380717134_391978522941460480 x	Jason Witten is killer to the Eagles as DJax is to the Giants...
