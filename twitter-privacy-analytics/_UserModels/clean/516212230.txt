516212230_383888319446147072 x	Where does this GF rank? Wasn't a great spectacle, that's for sure. But we've been spoiled recent years. Was still better than a lot in 80s.

516212230_366948988362047490 x	OK, that's me done. Good luck, boys. Want to be reading about a Warner ton and 2-3 for plenty more when I wake up! #Ashes
