1170634285_339877100871901184 x	Delmon Young is overpaid at a buck 380. This is getting like last year's Eagles. Unwatchable and unlikable. Bring in Tony Larusa to reinvent
1170634285_339528259475738624 x	Why would you run the same lineup as last night out there when they couldn't do anything against CY Young Jr.
1170634285_339527473719017472 x	Delmon Young is stealing money
1170634285_339527065428697088 x	Cliff will now cruise to a 1-1 tie through ten
1170634285_339525830340386816 x	John Mayberry Jr. = poop
1170634285_339506907767263232 x	Its not Ruben's fault that these undisciplined bums can't score runs. The manager has lost the team. Relieve Charlie and Mayberry now please
1170634285_339183262494752768 x	Thank goodness John Mayberry Jr. is in the outfield for defensive purpo.......oh, never mind. Go back to Little League son.
1170634285_338828673786445824 x	Only NASCAR would let you bring scaffolding and sofas to watch an event.
1170634285_338827008119275520 x	@KevinCooney oh gooddy a Victorino story just what we want to read right before we watch the Phillies get no-hit tomorrow.
1170634285_338775576515063809 x	Maybe Hamels needs a taste of Lehigh Valley if he can't win at this level
1170634285_338680580931715072 x	F1 on the tube this morning was kinda cool but hard to watch without a good analyst. Too bad Wheels and Sarge aren't available
1170634285_338679716653432832 x	Phil Jackson exposes Michael Jordan as the fraud that he is but is wrong on Russell. Wilt, Wilt, and only Wilt. Greatest athlete of all time
1170634285_336633105324593153 x	Can't watch the game thinking about Moore OK
1170634285_336239931712212993 x	Smoke and Mirrors win man-Get Galvis into these games immediatly-OF shoulld be Ruff/Brown/Galvis-Tommy Joseph starting catcher-Seacrest out!
1170634285_335165370757419009 x	RIP Dick Trikle
1170634285_334089013369663488 x	Dutch is and will always be the man. If we had Dutch in uniform this undisciplined play would not be tolerated. #putdutchincharge
1170634285_333580671450767360 x	Piling up RBI's on double play balls is not helping the team, its a rally killer. Being the last batter in the game is getting old #epicfail
1170634285_333579951301353472 x	Watch film, improve yourself, don't just go up there and flail away hoping to make contact, soon we'll play your music for the walk back
1170634285_333579246419189762 x	Ryan Howard = KKKKKKKKKKKKKK No plate discipline, no baseball smarts. This guy is hurting the team more than an injured Halladay #everyday
1170634285_333417078948245504 x	Phillies:please have Mayberry's and Bastardo's bags packed so I can drive them to the airport

1170634285_333190538113187840 x	I just woke up. Is Charlie still the manager? Time to start flying planes and banners over the stadium. Living, breathing idiot. Were doomed
1170634285_333040516239351809 x	Mayberry? Really? Really? Just penciling his name into the lineup should be enough to get you fired #hecantplay
1170634285_331560023673159680 x	Ruben I've supported you until now....I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit...you are full of turds
1170634285_331154775628476418 x	That's the T Ball team that's beating them 12-0
1170634285_330113162378633217 x	Michael Young is dragging this team down
1170634285_329768305575460865 x	#brutal
1170634285_329402673596071938 x	Somebody put one in somebody's earflap NOW
1170634285_329389064291766273 x	Halladay looked like when he threw the perfect game........... except for the runs and hits #epicfail
1170634285_328590267714244608 x	Hey Ryan Howard stop admiring your non homeruns if you can't run, that's Jimmy Rollinsesque and not acceptable that is lazy, lazy, lazy.
1170634285_329341946856361984 x	@TruBro69 yea as long as the ball clears the wall yo
1170634285_328532510038433792 x	RT @corrado_19: #RyanHoward finally getting hot, Charlie benches him. Do you see now why we have to take the car keys away from the head co?
1170634285_328529911784558592 x	Oh where, oh where have you gone Pat Gillick, oh where oh where can you be???
1170634285_328529633572167681 x	Another stellar move by Amaro DFA'ing the wrong catcher and Mayberry is still on the roster. Maybe a wholesale change at the top would do it
