554695511_396433330268553216 x	@Al_DeLaurentis give berube a chance. I agree with the homer assessment. But I'm not ready to say chief won't be a good coach.
554695511_396291841718747136 x	@Al_DeLaurentis did you hear patrick roy say they offered flyers their first round pick but homer wanted downie instead? Wth!!!!
554695511_396292403059232768 x	@Al_DeLaurentis that's exactly my thoughts!!! I hope to god that's not true. If it is homer needs to go.
554695511_396293268432244736 x	@Al_DeLaurentis would be that dumb!! 2/2
554695511_396295557637230593 x	@Al_DeLaurentis big fan of talbot. But I see the potential upgrade. Max was kinda in a pointless role with flyers. Hall can fill it.
554695511_396297021344460800 x	@Al_DeLaurentis hahaha I need sleep. Wrote edler and meant ben eager. #wayoff #imanidiot
554695511_396299757779697664 x	@Al_DeLaurentis I think read has been good!!
554695511_396303456505704448 x	@Al_DeLaurentis yeah same here. But I like the scoring threat he has with couts.Finally couts is playing with talent. And he's been better 2
554695511_396305214854422528 x	@Al_DeLaurentis def. g need to shoot tonight. He always pass 1st and never shoots.
554695511_396306012984344576 x	@Al_DeLaurentis yeah that no look pass to vinny was sick
554695511_396309765485510657 x	@Al_DeLaurentis not that I seen but heard that downie going LW with g and vinny
554695511_396313097075720192 x	@Al_DeLaurentis yeah max wasting on the fourth line really doesn't help much. In my opinion
554695511_396315728019984384 x	@Al_DeLaurentis I know man in three years once all those guys are here it will be sick!!!
554695511_396316607494230017 x	@Al_DeLaurentis yeah I'm starting to believe that morin will b in Philly next year.But hagg has another year MODO deal so idk how that works
554695511_396321711114944512 x	@Al_DeLaurentis trade to the oilers for picks. #toppicks!! Lol
554695511_396333361108901888 x	@Al_DeLaurentis no idea. What would you do?
554695511_396297555270963200 x	@Al_DeLaurentis on this team? Mason. Haha that's about it to me.
554695511_395188949280649216 x	@Al_DeLaurentis what do you want the eagles to do in next years draft?
554695511_395191710848131072 x	@Al_DeLaurentis same! Manziel I guess. Whoever needs to be mobile and also needs to have a swagger to him.
554695511_395217075217920002 x	@Al_DeLaurentis oh man hard to say. I think he can be but I'm no scout. I love mariota but he won't be available, baring injury or trade up
554695511_395219674063208448 x	@Al_DeLaurentis hard to say this early. But I agree with people that say next years qb isn't on the roster.
554695511_395223993919488000 x	@Al_DeLaurentis hahaha yeah that's what I said. But I'm an idiot  lol I think kiper has him projected around 13 or so tb as 2, and mm at 3
554695511_394482697336524800 x	Oh poor eagles writers about to get bombarded with Byrd to the eagles ?'s since Mort just had it in his hypothetical trades.
554695511_391967456618885120 x	@Al_DeLaurentis hahaha yeah I wouldn't put any stock in it. Are they even available? I'd rather have vanek to open up space for g #doubtful
554695511_391968174343999488 x	@Al_DeLaurentis yeah that's the thing. I don't ever wanna give up simmer. And have a hard time parting with the 1st round pick #prongerdeal
554695511_391969672880738305 x	@Al_DeLaurentis Jesus! Well you would have to clear major cap space. So we talking jake coby simmer prob read Laughton I would think could b
