1292556560_395257456659419136 x	Time for #Flyers to trade Coburn to the #Flames while they need another defenseman. Mark Giordano OUT 6-8 weeks.
1292556560_394877815834693632 x	I'd love to see the #Flyers somehow grab Moulson. Always been a fan of him. I'm sure #Sabres would deal him for a pick/prospect.
1292556560_394878835532906496 x	@bbrbrts Man, I'd be so happy lol
1292556560_394829096636526593 x	@FlyGoalScoredBy @torbald2895 I thought everyone was still comparing him to Jordan Staal
1292556560_394829695952252928 x	@torbald2895 @FlyGoalScoredBy Coots or Staal?
1292556560_394831791720108032 x	@torbald2895 @FlyGoalScoredBy I'm all for trading Coots if it nets a top pairing D but other than that I'd rather move Schenn.
1292556560_394832505976545280 x	@torbald2895 I like Couturier against top lines. He plays sound overall game. Schenn still hasn't "broken out" despite constant chances to.
1292556560_394833465993986048 x	@torbald2895 I felt that way before, but he's not a rookie anymore. How long can we use the "potential" excuse? Cut bait while value's high.
1292556560_394834463437238272 x	@BeeTEE15 Coots is used more as a "shut-down" guy, and he does it well. Schenn's job is to score, and he doesn't. Not consistently, at least
1292556560_394836621830270976 x	@bbrbrts @BeeTEE15 My whole point was that Coots is used in different situations. You can't compare the two offensively.
1292556560_394837969795706880 x	@BeeTEE15 @bbrbrts If anything, Laughton is more of a Schenn type player - probably with more of an offensive edge.
1292556560_394838824833921024 x	TOTAL # OF GOALS SINCE 2011-12: Couturier (17); B. Schenn (20). Coots used in way more defensive situations. Time to cut bait with Schenn?
1292556560_393554330113945600 x	Is it just me, or does Matt Read look like a young Simon Gagne? #Flyers
1292556560_393556559944359937 x	@caribou_16 I meant like his physical appearance lol
1292556560_393372884640362496 x	Will say this: The writing is on the wall for #Flyers B. Schenn. If he doesn't start producing - he's gone. Contract year and has BIG value.
1292556560_390472262077259776 x	What do we need, Ed? Another trade? Fire someone else? Maybe what's best for the organization is your official resignation. #Flyers
