109975501_376866749359988736 x	@JSalisburyCSN Why was Rollins back in the lineup?
109975501_376866577364156416 x	@taylorswift13 @caseyjames T.S: you should have seen Carrie on SNF, she was outstanding. #CarrieUnderwood  rocks!!!
109975501_376688260015091714 x	@amyfadoolCSN I trust Leslie won something as well, she is the best reporter in the city.

109975501_376510975286849536 x	@lesliegudel Is Freddy in because of Rollins' antics last night?
109975501_376357280297414657 x	@jodymacman Would your Dad have told the manager to sit Rollins after his lazy display again last night? He is embarrasing and has to go
109975501_376045698359111680 x	@WIPMorningShow #hollisthomas is gutless, piling on about Riley Cooper #getoveritfatboy
109975501_376036768404877312 x	@howardeskin @BonJovi Must be a very bright kid with a lot of foresight. Well done!!! PS Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame

109975501_375354114269401088 x	@MyPhillyGolf It's about time Furyk was put on the shelf, we needed some new blood
109975501_375051701297745920 x	@TonyBrunoShow That is great CFL knowledge. Who is the QB, Warren Moon or Tommy Clements?
109975501_374356252735729664 x	@howardeskin @FOX29philly @caplannfl Go get'em, H
109975501_374303529621389312 x	@amyfadoolCSN  No tweets from the Deutsche Bank?, great event!
109975501_374328479438737408 x	@amyfadoolCSN Lot to cover this time of year. Go 'Birds!
109975501_374172455146774528 x	@lesliegudel Class guy, too bad we couldn't find a taker for Jimmy the quitter.
109975501_374172161948147713 x	@howardeskin Michael Young deserved better than watching Jimmy jog to first base. He is a winner and I wish him well. #classactM.Y.
109975501_373851334484561920 x	@28CGiroux @Eagles G, the O loks great and we will score points and the special teams are much  improved, the D is the X-factor. #goflyers!!
109975501_373504385239642112 x	@KellyTilghmanGC Mickelson always plays well against Eldrick, go figure
109975501_373504195338313728 x	@975ShowSheet @TonyBrunoShow How about Fitz Dixon?
109975501_372893723765374976 x	@cm_rocks @thebandperry The best live band in country music, bar none. #theyarethequeenofthenewmillenium
109975501_372893131026337792 x	@MikeMiss975 #jimmythejogger cares only about himself. He's lazy, unmotivated and a divisive influence on the team. #ridusofjroll
109975501_372513357581914112 x	@TonyBrunoShow Excellent Mutt knowledge. They had more there in the Ed Kranepool days
109975501_372513054249844736 x	@howardeskin @SportsRadioWIP Rhea is lucky to have a job, she's nothing but negative and adds little.
109975501_372459120592306176 x	@howardeskin @SportsRadioWIP You let him off the hook with the GM question. It is not JUST a player evaluation job, it is much more
109975501_372458465324576768 x	@YO_RANDYJACKSON @TheDoctors Good luck, Randy
109975501_372396646140608512 x	@thompsonsquare Will T.S. be at the CMA Fest in 2014?
109975501_372167575041368064 x	@thebandperry Kimberly, everything you do is #1
109975501_372167366567686146 x	@TonyBrunoShow @JohnKincade @chuckwoolery Good Mama Bruno knowledge.
109975501_371948999189610496 x	@WIPMorningShow @beasleyreece I hope Beasley is right but the D is scary
109975501_371791475614302208 x	@amyfadoolCSN More Eldrick love. Adam won the tournament.
109975501_371807689577230336 x	@amyfadoolCSN  Who woulda thunk it?
109975501_371791905610149889 x	@lesliegudel  Could be a helluva 4th ot 5th outfielder next year. We need a couple of inexpensive guys who can fill out the roster and play
109975501_371330788551168000 x	@robellis94 @SportsRadioWIP Ray is off base today. The NFL winners always play the same way. Did Bart Starr pass as much as Brady/Brees?
109975501_371084407127293952 x	@KellyTilghmanGC Is he the only playing at the Barclay's?
109975501_371084198968184832 x	@KellyTilghmanGC Poor baby, go change his diaper
109975501_371083949625200640 x	@SargeSaidWhat Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
109975501_370876563341840384 x	@WIPMorningShow Charlie is a class act, will always be beloved in Philly
109975501_370677132826902528 x	@TonyBrunoShow @DEBphl If Billy (whiteshoes) shows up, all the way from Chichester, will he be allowed to stay?
109975501_370694979078721536 x	@TonyBrunoShow @DEBphl That's good Johnson knowledge. PS Widener's own
109975501_370557570525564929 x	@MikeandIke94WIP @SportsRadioWIP Ike, quit apologizing for Jimmythejogger. One rule; run hard, it's not that tough. #noexcuses  #jrollquits
109975501_370264900603371520 x	@KellyTilghmanGC I hope someone was there to change his diaper. Poor little Eldrick
109975501_370174405508214785 x	@WIPMorningShow @lesliegudel Leslie did a fabulous job, Charlie maintains the utmost respect for Leslie and it allows for honest dialogue
109975501_369992426082930689 x	#lesliegudel the vignette Leslie did with Charlie was perfect, she is the quintessential pro and this kind of repartee will be missed
109975501_369622523853303811 x	@JSalisburyCSN Once a dog...
109975501_369634166305857536 x	@howardeskin @JSalisburyCSN Exactly
109975501_369622850207899648 x	@lesliegudel He was a fabulous player, I hope his leadership carries over. #jimmy'sstilladog
109975501_369560035191312384 x	@TonyBrunoShow Tony is the undisputed King of the hot list. #tonyhasnopeer
109975501_369559842920222720 x	@JSalisburyCSN You can't a malcontent to run hard to first. You want to or you don't. That simple. #whydoesheevenhavetotrytocoax?
109975501_369402766705164290 x	@johnclarknbc10 I don't care as much about the average or OBP, I care more about the jogging to first. Enough!!! #jrollgottago
109975501_369402552002957312 x	@JSalisburyCSN Rollins needs to take a hike, no room for laziness in Philly. #jrollgottago
109975501_369266372397629440 x	@lesliegudel We need a major purge at the end of the seaon. #dowhattheredsoxdid
109975501_369266113210613760 x	@KellyTilghmanGC The ball wasn't for her, it was for a friend back home. Perhaps Paula should have asked for HER autograph
109975501_368789520088449024 x	@howardeskin Very interesting
109975501_368681419641348097 x	@lesliegudel Your special bond with Charlie was evident, I will miss that.
