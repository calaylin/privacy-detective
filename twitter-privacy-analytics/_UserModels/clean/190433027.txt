190433027_398709426212724736 x	@EziosVengeance I think Shanahan is going to be gone.
190433027_398712611480408064 x	@EziosVengeance  I agree. I am still wondering why Shanahan strayed away from the running game against Denver in the 2nd half.
190433027_398546830058729472 x	@EziosVengeance I think Utah is getting it. They are tanking themselves.
190433027_398546719954051072 x	@EziosVengeance Phillies need young hitting.
190433027_397518604691722240 x	@EziosVengeance All pregame shows are terrible, Mike.
190433027_397498909276119041 x	@EziosVengeance The Patriots scare me for whatever reason.
190433027_399742154697760768 x	@TheMiamiQueet @phillyMetsfan @dtrainn77 I am fuming. I am calling up Moose to talk about this tonight. i am furious.
190433027_399743111888257024 x	@phillyMetsfan @TheMiamiQueet @dtrainn77 C'mon stop. It's not. No one does this in an work environment. It's assault.
190433027_399745737770020864 x	@phillyMetsfan @TheMiamiQueet @dtrainn77 Uh no.
190433027_399736986006605824 x	@AnthonyG1982 Ask @dtrainn77. I got an issue with this. This was a player-on-player crime. This was a black-on-black crime.
190433027_399727383332151296 x	@phillyMetsfan Show this to @dtrainn77: https://t.co/ouC3HtEYeC Tell him I hate this and we need to end hazing together.
190433027_399730339913814016 x	@phillyMetsfan @dtrainn77 If this video wasn't black on black crime, what is? It reminded me of what slavery was.
190433027_399731363890216960 x	@phillyMetsfan  What's @dtrainn77 thoughts on this?
190433027_399733191080026112 x	@phillyMetsfan Dude that's Anthony Davis. He plays for the Pelicans. He was last year's #1 draft pick in the NBA,
190433027_399734131329740800 x	@phillyMetsfan Whether he likes it or not, there's no place for this in any work environment.
190433027_399735174952284160 x	@phillyMetsfan I was told to clean toilets, and I had enough of being disrespected at TSC. Carter is a bad guy.
190433027_399735566738014208 x	@phillyMetsfan Thanks. Do you watch Joel Osteen?
190433027_399606110111272960 x	Nets should fire Jason Kidd now. He has no business coaching. His players don't take him seriously. He is so lost as coach.
190433027_399690626230259712 x	@phillyMetsfan Can't be worse.
190433027_399094178019155968 x	@JoeandEvan  I marveled to Demetri that the Knicks were a special team in the 90s, They were fun to watch. Very likable. Easy to root for.
190433027_399195498382237696 x	@phillyMetsfan @JoeandEvan  Knicks ran into Michael though. What can anyone do? Lot of great players lost to Michael. It happens.
190433027_399275110026067968 x	@phillyMetsfan @JoeandEvan I am not being a shill. I am being realistic & reasonable. Even Demetri Adrahtas said Knicks shouldn't be ashamed
190433027_398652264690106368 x	@phillyMetsfan I love Cote.
190433027_398653184064757760 x	@bburke0920 @phillyMetsfan Wedge is 20 x better than Collins.
190433027_398655066703290368 x	@phillyMetsfan @metsfanmurph @bburke0920 I wish Eric Wedge was coaching at Tottenville High School.
190433027_398656464450887680 x	@phillyMetsfan @bburke0920 @dtrainn77 STFU then.
190433027_398657015343366144 x	@phillyMetsfan @bburke0920 @dtrainn77 Go away.
190433027_398657335821737984 x	@phillyMetsfan @bburke0920 Tell @dtrainn77 to unblock me.
190433027_398667698428588033 x	@phillyMetsfan @bburke0920 @dtrainn77 You know I was clowning around, right?
190433027_398674228045565952 x	@phillyMetsfan @bburke0920 @dtrainn77 How he is a terrible manager? He was 5 minutes away from going to the World Series in 2007.
190433027_398679619869503488 x	@phillyMetsfan @dtrainn77 Are you really serious?
190433027_398680407928885249 x	@phillyMetsfan @dtrainn77 Childress was 5 minutes from going to the Super Bowl. Izzo won a national title. Randolph got screwed.
190433027_398680863975546880 x	@phillyMetsfan @dtrainn77 But they don't work in NY.
190433027_398677681350270976 x	@phillyMetsfan  I am furious  @dtrainn77 is not inducted in the Tottenville Football Hall of Fame.
190433027_398679798165143553 x	@phillyMetsfan @dtrainn77 I will write a letter to SI ADVANCE.
190433027_398638822885314560 x	@phillyMetsfan Very late. 3:30 a.m.
190433027_398540720455176192 x	@metsfanmurph @tim55081 Because I rip teams in town. I am not a shill like @TheReal_C_Murda
190433027_398292578996477952 x	@phillyMetsfan I have no idea. This whole thing has gotten to the point now we are into psychobabbling what Martin thinks.
190433027_398294679818473472 x	@phillyMetsfan Why did Dennis block me? #Dennis
190433027_398281653140729856 x	@phillyMetsfan I love it. We will drink angry orchard in two weeks in Philly, Chris.
190433027_398276180446420992 x	Is anyone getting tired of Jonathan Martin now? Maybe it's time for him to speak up and get this over with.
190433027_398276950214459393 x	@phillyMetsfan This also shows poor leadership by the coaches and poor culture by the front office. You think Patriots allow this nonsense?
190433027_398278581702238208 x	@phillyMetsfan Come to think of it, there are lot of bad guys now in lot of football teams. So much pressure comes from winning.
190433027_398279096985059329 x	@phillyMetsfan John Idzik to his credit has brought guys with character on the team particularly Willie Colon and several others this year.
190433027_398276970921742337 x	@phillyMetsfan Whole thing is getting old. The way Martin handled it  wasn't good obviously with the way everyone on the team is outspoken
190433027_398242702501748736 x	@bburke0920 I will rant on the Knicks at 8.
190433027_398243795340259328 x	@phillyMetsfan @bburke0920 No one.
