15291490_391045166213369856 x	@3DPhillySports No, now I'm hearing Ritchie shouldn't have been traded since he's a better Capt. Hahaha!
15291490_391045955602374656 x	@3DPhillySports there must be something in the water. Short-term memory loss is prevalent in these parts.
15291490_391237926786707456 x	@ManOfAllSteins @3DPhillySports Giroux isn't a 3rd line player. With a young team you have to give it time. Shouldn't be this bad, but...
15291490_391254202615623680 x	@ManOfAllSteins @3DPhillySports no, he's elite. They're pressing. When the whole team presses you're off. It happene with Pens 2 years ago.
15291490_391256944922460161 x	@3DPhillySports @ManOfAllSteins Voracek is not garbage, Simmonds, Read, etc. It's a knee-jerk reaction to a bad start.
15291490_396749534627237888 x	@dmaco215 Yep, people saying that they miss 18 & 17 aren't the issue. Pronger was the key especially 2010.
15291490_396754045911576577 x	@dmaco215 @Flyergirl88 @GutterTheGreat Hexy won't make a difference unless he speaks to Snider. They all work for the Hand.
15291490_399063045122826240 x	Anyone know which NFL team Vince Lombardi's Packers ever suffered defeat to in the playoffs?
15291490_395776086178791424 x	So I catch you trying to TP my house. I walk you back, keep the TP. Five minutes later, your house is fucked! Don't mess!
