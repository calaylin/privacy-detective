1350239239_365932954603626497 x	@JohnPhilMLU "The Pulsar is a new disc. Some were hesitant to embrace it. But it makes the game more exciting and players will adjust."
1350239239_365976039198949376 x	@JohnPhilMLU Yes. But everybody already knows that, because it's true. Trying to convince people otherwise makes him seem oblivious at best.
1350239239_365933433240821760 x	@JohnPhilMLU Other options would have been to not answer the question, or at least not try to twist stats in his favor.
1350239239_359016299277467648 x	Watching PoNY in the Terminus final makes me wonder what kind of damage they could have done in the AUDL or MLU had they all played together
1350239239_354375986474782725 x	@JohnPhilMLU Nope, Josh Markette had multiple 10 point games too.
1350239239_354637100852854784 x	@JohnPhilMLU @DannyFrisbee1 Cricket is Josh Markette. He had a great year, came on really strong in the second half of the season.
1350239239_354377630885224449 x	@JohnPhilMLU I guess the selection depends on how much value is placed on wins compared to individual stats.
1350239239_354378428398583810 x	@JohnPhilMLU Do you know if the vote totals are going to be released?
1350239239_351506118041804801 x	Playoffs set in the AUDL Eastern Conference. NY vs. PHI in the first round, winner plays Toronto Aug 3 in the conference final in Chicago.
1350239239_349296616026550272 x	@JohnPhilMLU Any idea when regular season stats will be finalized and released?
1350239239_350348498333478912 x	@JohnPhilMLU Any word on if they come out today? Or if maybe I could get the numbers for 14 specific players for an article?
