61672843_387027311213940736 x	The media wants a QB controversy so HARD! It's not there. If Vick is healthy, he's the QB. Don't try to create something, report something.
61672843_386977514897559552 x	Pretty impressive how Foles steps in and the offense didn't miss a beat. A healthy Vick is still the best option, but it's still comforting.

61672843_386932303475523584 x	@cjamesPhilly ha! Maybe. He's a rookie tho, and a 5th rounder.
61672843_386935677994401793 x	@cjamesPhilly yup
