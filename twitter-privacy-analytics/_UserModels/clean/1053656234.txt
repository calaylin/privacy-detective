1053656234_392627073946103808 x	@sbaickerCSN @PearlJam If I see you at a Nickleback show with a t-shirt canon then you can apologize
1053656234_395364872726130688 x	Some players who started well really crapped the bed late in the game.Need to find some speed badly,Flyers look exhausted late in most games
1053656234_394939955044024320 x	Now if Mason didn't work out and Flyers signed Miller in the off-season, that I'd get. Asking price of Couturier for a UFA goalie? No thanks
1053656234_394951788266156032 x	@KitKat_P @jsaquella it was @DougMaclean on Hockey Central at noon, I guess he has no love for his former goalie Steve Mason.
1053656234_394954674236698624 x	totally understand the logic @DougMaclean but I think Mason/Emery can be effective.I feel Flyers #1 need is a top pairing dman, not a goalie
1053656234_394850447724273664 x	@davegisaac @flyer_hockey007 The Ducks are a fast team and don't dress a goon, no need for Rosehill to be anywhere near the starting lineup
1053656234_394271569305796608 x	What you gonna do when the Flyers drop the hammer on you. WOOOOOOOOOOOO
1053656234_394176535462035456 x	Going to a nacho party and best nachos wins. I am making pizza nachos (pepperoni, Bacon, onion, gr olives, hot pepper, extra cheese)
1053656234_393533897956274176 x	Flyers aren't scoring and the PP is sucking but unless I'm the biggest Homer ever, Flyers have had the much better chances, just missed tons
1053656234_393109952425766912 x	If they're going to keep McGinn/Raffl and just scratch them anyway makes no sense to keep them but I feel they should play, add to team IMO
1053656234_393116805348077568 x	@bbrbrts I think he could play a 4th line like Campbell/Paille in Boston. Maybe 8-10 minutes a night, make the 4th line useful with 25/18
1053656234_393118593254060032 x	@bbrbrts The golden 4th line is the Wings old Grindline, would love for something similar someday soon.
1053656234_392707746820153344 x	Sounds like the Panthers Kulikov is on the block, Homer buddy, make that call. Curious from Flyers and non Flyers fans what a fair return is
1053656234_394275405068136449 x	Flyers have scored 4 goals and are winning. Flyers beat writers are not happy, where is the drama? Sad sad day to be a Flyers beat.
1053656234_394161180681330689 x	The only way my question is answered is if the Flyers start scoring, I'd love to see some goals tonight.
1053656234_394160713305833472 x	Isles play back 2 back after a tough game against Pens. Flyers need to roll 4 lines and make them skate for 60. Rosehill doesn't allow that
1053656234_392389343035142144 x	No Vanek, No Hemsky. If the Flyers are going to make a blockbuster then get the #1 need and that's a top pairing dman. No brainer.
1053656234_389760158684827648 x	@RealRocket22 If you were Flyers GM and could make one move today, what would it be? Just one move, don't need to name names.
1053656234_389763960947216384 x	@RealRocket22 I have no doubt many Flyers fans would love having you back with the Flyers in some capacity. My #1 need, a puck moving Dman
1053656234_389766434256990208 x	@RealRocket22 Many Flyers fans agree with you, Carlyle doesn't seem to like him. I like Petry from Oilers and I'd kick tires on a few others
