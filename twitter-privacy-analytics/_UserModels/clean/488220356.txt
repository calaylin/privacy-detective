488220356_387598070994960384 x	The comments on this are just precious.  http://t.co/sWddt0P4HW
488220356_377221040768040961 x	Haha, there is one Redskins fan in Circle Tavern and he is doing the lightest golf clap on any good Redskins play.
488220356_354762405579993088 x	@ryanlawrence21 @whereskernan @KevinCooney The Sandlot is the most overrated baseball movie ever.
488220356_340254185784229888 x	Phils need to go to the maroon 1970-80s uniforms.
488220356_325190005481930754 x	Interviewing a witness who apparently time traveled from 1985 on CNN. Think she was the skater girl I had a secret crush on.
488220356_291545268728520704 x	Seriously, articles like that are why only brain damaged people read Bleacher Report. It?s an embarrassment to humanity.
488220356_394267189617754112 x	I hate the in-game interviews.
488220356_384420247195107328 x	No worries, Eagles only on pace to give up 86 points.
488220356_368445176119037952 x	And I know everyone wants Amaro to take the heat, and rightfully so. But this is David Montgomery's baby now.
488220356_368067853511294976 x	6 innings, 3 runs and a HR allowed by Halladay. Just mediocre enough to leave everyone totally uncertain about where he'll be.
488220356_367122649551761409 x	Mini-Mart comes in to play CF, Capt. Dead Ass moves to RF for Ruf.
488220356_367112216321212416 x	Asche had to slow down his home-run trot because he was going to lap Ruf.
488220356_366022063691005953 x	Thanks to Ruf rallying the Phils, they are 22nd out of 30 teams in RF production. If you go by Delmon's numbers only they'd be bottom five.
488220356_364932210249314306 x	Papelbon about as popular as scabies in Philly right now.
488220356_364204474103234560 x	John Mayberry Jr. leads the league in getting picked off second base and various other idiotic feats.
488220356_355502032041426945 x	Papelbon, a little confused about what the No. 1 looks like.
488220356_352826004248608768 x	Cooney is caving to Reuben Frank pressure and badmouthing Springsteen. #traitor #deporthim
488220356_352590501607776257 x	I think John Lannan needs a Fresca.
488220356_352242164429897728 x	Friendly reminder that the pitching coach makes these calls, really.
488220356_352241706172813313 x	Nope, this is DeFratus. Why this is not Papelbon is boggling.
488220356_326159734459727873 x	Wait, there's an inherited runner still out there!
488220356_376355959595364352 x	I think the guy from Double Dare is getting goofed on by fake Delco accounts & I've been sucked in it. #DELCO
488220356_376347456466092032 x	@meechone nice pink bag, cupcake!
488220356_376348263215280129 x	@meechone yeah, yeah, like you are sharing your sneaker closet with her Smh.
488220356_376354623902461952 x	@Ibatvmc I had no idea that you were, so no.
488220356_376355234651852800 x	@Ibatvmc no, I think it's someone just messing with you.
488220356_384084054318260224 x	Braves do a Robin Thicke spoof. https://t.co/Vf3BLhtmBZ
488220356_384089145720991744 x	@BRK_rusty The girls in it are not.
488220356_384093242423537664 x	@BRK_rusty It doesn't. Their Tomahawk Crew is phenomenal.
488220356_377396909323087873 x	They really should just trade Nick Foles, because there is no way that offense can be flattering to his skill set.
488220356_375664888154435585 x	This is my weekend. http://t.co/DoQRCkq3C3
488220356_370929693593464832 x	He was hitting for a decent average for a while before that, but if you were watching his hits weren't exactly jumping off the bat.

488220356_329378820257902592 x	If Delmon Young hits another homer this game, the hipsters are totally jumping off the wagon.
488220356_321410661664047106 x	It's an ethos. Perhaps flawed, but an ethos. RT @brookob: 2-0 count on every hitter this inning for Halladay.
488220356_321404400109240320 x	Roy's big problems have been from the stretch. Let's see how this goes.
488220356_321407883663245312 x	@BRK_rusty thanks, Roy has work to do if he's going to survive 6 IP
488220356_321260074465128448 x	When you have Aumont & Bastardo in your bullpen there is no reason to use Chad Durbin w/ runners on in a winnable game. Ever.
488220356_280767212510404608 x	Amazingly, he's been an even bigger disappointment than I thought he'd be since then. And I definitely envisioned a shit show.
488220356_280767063641972736 x	I'm tellin' you, as soon as the organization crapped on T.O. after the Super Bowl, that was it for Andy Reid in my mind.
488220356_279762167337742338 x	WAT?!?! RT @rupertmurdoch: Terrible news today. When will politicians find courage to ban automatic weapons?  As in Oz after similar tragedy
488220356_276079499689484288 x	The Phillies would have to dump so much money to Arizona in an Upton-for-Lee trade.
488220356_276072924983734272 x	I'd rather have Pagan at the number he signed for than Victorino at the number the Red Sox allegedly are offering.
488220356_276075725264662529 x	@BRK_rusty I just don't think the Nats are going to trade Morse to a rival.

488220356_384420980460113920 x	Did the Soul win the title? By that I mean, did Arena Football disband again?
488220356_382873507014909953 x	I'm giving you 2 choices for the Phils, pick 1: 1) trade Dom Brown for a power-hitting RH bat 2) trade Cody Asche to clear room for Franco.
488220356_422162675876241408 x	This is either insane, or would be the biggest sports find ever if it exists, because there is no video record of Wilt's 100-point game.
