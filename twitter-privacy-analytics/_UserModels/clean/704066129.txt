704066129_396473023626489856 x	@Ray_bouch ok. First off nobody "wants" Crosby hurt. Secondly, being hurt and taken to hospital two completely different things
704066129_396468554092273664 x	@Ray_bouch @sbaickerCSN @HockeyMeesh they call flyer fans assholes. That's just fucked up.
704066129_396464009261895680 x	@CrackerJacker93 kids ? Give one example. You shouldn't be "welcomed@ into an away stadium or you're doing it wrong
704066129_396463469295599616 x	@RoobCSN Roob!! It's the NBA. How long have the sixers been mediocre. Need a star like Julius Randle/wiggins
704066129_396463177590145025 x	@Winless4Wiggins @YouWant2KnowMe @OffthemarkRoca I personally like Randle better
704066129_396452121329303552 x	@CrackerJacker93 @jessespector reason for hating ?
704066129_396454334864842752 x	@CrackerJacker93 @jessespector so what. If you cheer for another team in their stadium you deserve it.
704066129_396461858729000960 x	@CrackerJacker93 do you want them to welcome and give opposing fans hugs ?
704066129_396455728514625536 x	@gardsup22 @RoobCSN because in the NBA you can't get good until your really bad. See: sixers last 10 years. Never ending cycle of average
704066129_396453587091722240 x	@JakePavorsky @PS_Faithful it's actually awesome
704066129_396453225605627904 x	@JoshFeitknecht @hockeyfights shut up pussy
704066129_396452076466614274 x	@FischettI9 @jessespector why you a hater ?
704066129_396451910108344320 x	@RoobCSN @PHISportsPhans @EliotShorrParks but there's also Randle who is a stud.
704066129_396111229720068097 x	@LesBowen it really wasn't that bad
