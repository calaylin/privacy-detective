48397743_169966483718414336 x	I can't wait to be old and wear my pants up to my nipples.
48397743_154775346477154305 x	@danielrquinn can you go to falls tomorrow? I got a ton of people going
48397743_154776093252009985 x	@danielrquinn yeah my bad for last time. I had work the day, before well night. Which you know I work till like 6 am. I fell asleep so, lol.
48397743_154776743893405697 x	@danielrquinn I'll go around 2. So you can get there whatever time you can.
48397743_152852283368030208 x	*foodbaby damn
48397743_152743262589956096 x	Being 6 foot tall and sleeping with w blanket that's 4 feet long #cold #tallboyprobz
48397743_152757870910382080 x	@danielrquinn go to falls for hockey later #yourbunsthough
48397743_152759298538217472 x	@danielrquinn I'm thinking 1pm. It's supposed to be 52? by then. I just dont wanna play too long cause I have a game tonight
48397743_148929694627135489 x	Lol for anyone who knows family guy pretty well. http://t.co/ZDWQB9eo
48397743_141725148561678337 x	@danielrquinn I have been there a few times over the last couple weeks the surface is a lot like the sportsplex now. We just don't have nets
48397743_141727686409195520 x	@danielrquinn I'd so do that. I'd never at falls again. And I can't even play sportsplex next season unless theres a Saturday league
48397743_141728911091433473 x	@danielrquinn there's an opening on my team since I left, but that's if your willing to play in the silver division #d1playerstatus
48397743_141729523191394305 x	@danielrquinn it's higher haha. Sportsplex has 3 divisions: Copper, Bronze, and Silver. No gold for some reason.
48397743_141730592671797249 x	@danielrquinn try going ice skating if you ever get a chance. Playing ice hockey made me 1,000 times better on rollerblades
48397743_141731445076000769 x	@danielrquinn my work is hiring again, couple days a week. And I actually have an extra pair you can have.
48397743_141732344615800832 x	@danielrquinn i think it fits 9-11. &ill ask if i see my boss tonight. I'm working right now. Been here since 9, done at 6:30
48397743_136881098914398208 x	@matthewbentz all star voting happens too early into the season. People base opinions from last seasons play. Now Crosby on it, is just dumb
48397743_135102218536878081 x	Eh not worried. That was the worst decision Papelbon made in his career #hisproblem
48397743_120419277647003648 x	Getting close to 1,000 tweets. wondering what im gonna tweet about for the big 1K
48397743_108725877881315329 x	I think I might bring weights with me to work? If I could workout during this downtime all the time id be #ripped
48397743_108727385138003968 x	@danielrquinn that's a quality idea Mr Quinn. Ill have to see how heavy they come. I'm already 183lbs. So maybe ill walk around at 250
48397743_108733992894861312 x	@danielrquinn I was about 3 or 4 months ago I was around 168. But I really started eating and lifting more
48397743_108739575530274816 x	@danielrquinn just wait Dan. One day ill be a tank
48397743_99142623213789184 x	Gonna get some grub at BWW.
