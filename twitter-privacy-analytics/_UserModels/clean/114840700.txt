114840700_399517030044672000 x	@NXML129 oh relax!!!!!!!
114840700_399517851075502080 x	@NXML129 I know bro and I'm just as excited as you for his future! All I was saying is let's judge his rookie year after 82 games :)
114840700_399519114529878017 x	@NXML129 I'm pretty pumped, I think the most promising part of his game is his D! In today's game a pg who locks up on d is clutch.
114840700_398155167826075648 x	@NXML129 how?
114840700_398155572916146176 x	@NXML129 so you get to try out the google glasses
114840700_398156234412408832 x	@NXML129 sick dude! How much are they? They look so dope!
114840700_397469515467874304 x	People need to relax with MCW... Only 3 games in let's judge him after 82
114840700_397476441144573952 x	@NXML129 it's okay to be excited but don't get ahead of yourself! 3 and 0 is cool and all but let's be real we wanna lose
114840700_397477037071695872 x	@NXML129 and that's fine, all I'm saying is people need to relax with the MCW hype it's 3 games bro 3 games
114840700_397479692292206593 x	@eNasty2345 @NXML129 I'm not mad tho lol why wouldn't I want him and the sixers to do well? But do you really wanna miss out on this draft?!
114840700_397480405021908992 x	@eNasty2345 @NXML129 you mean the 11th pick and we weren't in the playoffs lol
114840700_397481040186331136 x	@eNasty2345 @NXML129 MCW is gonna be the real deal tho. I'm a fan and was a fan of his at Cuse. Love tall PGs
