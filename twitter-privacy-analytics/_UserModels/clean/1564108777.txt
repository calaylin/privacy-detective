1564108777_393550722744451073 x	Mason with a .960 save percentage. AND he outlets the puck. #Flyers
1564108777_393549304654467073 x	We keep waiting for G to be G for an entire game but he only shows flashes. #Flyers
1564108777_393548690469945344 x	Shot it right. at. him.
1564108777_393547598696816641 x	I don't like B Schenn as center in the defensive zone AT ALL. #Flyers
1564108777_393546558597529600 x	Who's gonna get the empty netter? Mason deserves it. #Flyers
1564108777_393544391065092096 x	That's a kicked puck. BTW, why don't they allow kicking goals? More scoring, right?
1564108777_393540928222543872 x	@BroadStHockey Agreed. No suspension deserved. Wasn't really a hit from behind. Tht play can happen 200 times with no injury occurring
1564108777_393540188728983552 x	I really like 14. But 17 looks lost on that line. I think maybe it's best as 14, 24, 25. Let's hope Talbot's okay. #Flyers
1564108777_393539008804171776 x	That wasn't really a hit from from behind. It's a penalty, but marginal on a suspension. I'd say no. #Flyers
1564108777_393534430985613312 x	@CoverThePuck No you're right on. I'm with you
1564108777_393532525374894080 x	That power play took away our momentum. But man do I love Couturier. I wouldn't mind watching him play for the next 15 years. #Flyers
1564108777_393527975817515008 x	Thoughts on 1st period: Rangers weren't dangerous at all. Vinny picked up where he left off, best #Flyers forward. G nonexistent 5 on 5
1564108777_389161485513285632 x	@BroadStBull Could Mez be scratched because a trade to Edmonton is in the works?
1564108777_393524553886203904 x	#Flyers need to keep it much simpler. Way too many low percentage passes hitting Ranger players. Keep it in front of you, get it low, shoot
1564108777_393522947802943488 x	Streight looking great. Flying out there. But the rest of the #Flyers are watching, not moving feet, not getting open
1564108777_393519625000189952 x	Does anyone else think Matt Read is a much better player than it feels like he is? #Flyers
1564108777_393515305764663296 x	Kimmo with a solid hit on his first shift #Flyers
1564108777_393402461970767873 x	@BroadStHockey I like that 3rd line a lot. 17 should play that grit role and get most of his goals on the PP
1564108777_393400019182956544 x	@BroadStHockey Wait, G's on the wing?
1564108777_393367674627309568 x	@RealRocket22 Who are the tough Flyers that can play?
1564108777_393157402058436608 x	@billmeltzer Like, would Stevens have made the HOF so easily carrying a career full of suspensions with him?
1564108777_393157125557350402 x	@billmeltzer Hey Bill, love your blog & Flyerbuzz. With all these suspensions happening, any chance you want to talk about 88 and Stevens?
1564108777_393154243789881344 x	Would Scott Stevens have made the HOF so easily with a career full of suspensions in tow? #Flyers
1564108777_393154091956072448 x	All these suspension videos make me want retroactive justice for 88. #Flyers
1564108777_393126339059781632 x	BTW, L Schenn's only job on team should be making it hard to enter #Flyers zone. That's what he's good at
1564108777_393125765161549824 x	How about Luke Schenn "requesting" to skate with the scratches after practice.
1564108777_393114865687986176 x	@CoverThePuck McGinn for sure over Rosehill. Definitely. But what does Raffl give you if not playing in the top 9?
1564108777_393118379784945664 x	@CoverThePuck A Bostonesque 4th line would be great. I'd rather 25 in the middle of 12 and 36. Or, actually, 21 in the middle of 25 and 12
1564108777_393119245988421632 x	@CoverThePuck Amen
1564108777_393114275662688257 x	@JackMcCaffery When everyone healthy, does McGinn stay and play? Some say he's only good if playing in top 6, but I don't see why. Defense?
1564108777_393042322709295106 x	Kimmo has been bad all over the ice. RT @JackMcCaffery: Timonen on being demoted to 2nd #flyers PP: 'I'm mad ... at myself.'
1564108777_392712521259315200 x	@CoverThePuck Read, Cousins, and a 2nd rounder?
1564108777_392430629977329664 x	RT @CoverThePuck: all kidding aside the Flyers beat the Pens in the playoffs, went to see Nickleback and lost to the Devils then last seaso?
1564108777_392409160077160448 x	Really bad music, but how awesome was 88? #Flyers http://t.co/fKxG3ywA2L
1564108777_392288615394316288 x	Why #Flyers Couturier is the real deal and B Schenn has no business playing center: http://t.co/pNKbYZZDjq
1564108777_391944030583414784 x	@BroadStBull I heard a rumor that the Flyers are calling about the Sedin twins, and Vancouver is listening... Thoughts? Good idea? Bad idea?
1564108777_391017122291523584 x	Well I'm gonna go watch MacGyver reruns and try to pretend the season starts next Thurs. #Flyers
1564108777_391003524051779585 x	@BroadStBull Do you trade your 2014 first round pick for Vanek if you somehow know he'll resign? That 1st could be top 5
1564108777_390999972856229888 x	Timonen continuing his dreadful season.  #Flyers
1564108777_390998103865962496 x	This is unwatchable. #Flyers
1564108777_390840360798527488 x	I feel good about this game tonight  #Flyers
1564108777_390288883419582464 x	That just takes it all right out of you. #Flyers
1564108777_390132330599174144 x	Looking at that Vancouver lineup... how are they seen as a contender out west? #Flyers
1564108777_389870023193272320 x	That Datsyuk setup.

1564108777_389765355310047233 x	This is a beautiful article about #Flyers footwork and not going hard to the net. Really well done: http://t.co/YwOSbW2v6Y
1564108777_389759873409241089 x	That Nazim Kadri goal against Edmonton.
1564108777_389534865403568129 x	I think this #Flyers team is going to be alright. I really do.
1564108777_389400447879892992 x	The effort is there. The finer point of Chief's system will come. But soon enough? That's the story line for this year. #Flyers
1564108777_389204192172052481 x	I used to spend all day at work looking forward to #Flyers games. Now I spend all game looking forward to work
1564108777_389201464855625729 x	Timonen's had a real bad start to the season. Real bad. #Flyers
1564108777_389190389304815616 x	Mason clearly the guy. Ray is fine but just not as focused. Doesn't seem to want it as bad. Probably not doing that 7 minute thing #Flyers
1564108777_389187134156201984 x	#Flyers outplaying Wings here. Straight up. Just can't score.
1564108777_389183517244289024 x	G pretty much useless in this game. Good on face offs. Doing nothing else at all
1564108777_389182274904027136 x	Commerials for antidepressant medication really hitting home #Flyers
1564108777_389168786177548288 x	McGinn looks every big as good as he did last year. He should be up with the club instead of Rosehill. Can also fight if he has to
1564108777_389123447521284096 x	Watching Boston Columbus game. It's too bad about Seidenberg and Umberger. Bob not looking as good as Mason though. #Flyers
1564108777_389117641019101184 x	I think Laughton was sent back because Homer knew this team was in big trouble, didn't want to bring youngsters up into the mess. #Flyers
1564108777_389107955586846720 x	The only identity this #Flyers team had was in 2011-2012 as a comeback team. Kind of an awkward identity to have.
1564108777_389106898500583424 x	I keep thinking about that game last night... It was winnable. This #Flyers team has yet to develop an identity in the Giroux era
1564108777_389073048311037952 x	With Vinny and Hartnell down, #Flyers should have even more trouble scoring, but hockey does this thing sometimes where opposites happen
1564108777_389070482865000450 x	Glad to see it's McGinn and Raffl coming up. Maybe Raffl scores a Hertl goal? Too much to ask? #Flyers
1564108777_389033261688954880 x	G started looking like G last night. Couts and B Schenn are playing well. Mason continues to be great 7 minutes at a time. #Flyers
1564108777_388842926958448640 x	I will never not want to murder someone after a #Flyers loss
