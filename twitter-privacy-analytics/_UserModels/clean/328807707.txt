328807707_391015296766849024 x	This entire team owes Mason dinner and a heartfelt apology. And some FUCKING GOALS
328807707_391001207663116289 x	A goal? What is goal? What the FUCK was that horn sound? What is happening?!
328807707_391007800455086080 x	@KikiMmk Oh hush haha :P
328807707_391007096348495872 x	Flyers top secret game plan: Pass, pass, pass, fuck up pass, give up odd man rush. Have Mason bail you out. Repeat.

328807707_390999180446945280 x	Is it the 2014-2015 NHL season yet?
328807707_390998250771062784 x	@Bear_Kitten14 That'd be awesome if they let me, but I'll take what I got happily right now haha. Also, god damn we suck.
328807707_390996936280387584 x	@Bear_Kitten14 Fact. Also, think Jimmy's parents will let me run the team's twitter too? I'm clearly very politically correct/G rated haha

328807707_390988874953920512 x	It's cute that Tori Hunter still thinks he's famous. You're irrelevant.
328807707_390987167792504832 x	Rinaldo sounds like such a cocky douche. You have no skill. Your job is to hit. You'd be arguably more successful without a stick. Assclown
328807707_390986790170943488 x	Looks like the turf monster that took down Decker last year is putting in overtime at the WFC. That wasn't a trip. @RefYouSuck
328807707_390986405398081536 x	@Bear_Kitten14 @DJSmiley412 Nah he doesn't look bad tonight. Hoping he keeps it up.

328807707_390985152798552064 x	@DJSmiley412 I don't really like him, but apparently some people do. Idk the whole team's playing so shitty its hard to tell who's good haha
328807707_390981869715476480 x	Also, you'd think Max Lapierre would be less likely to cheap shot someone...ya know after Chara almost broke his neck and all.
328807707_390981466957438976 x	Anyone who watched with me knows I'm pretty quiet while watching the Flyers, right? Yeah not with these Flyers. These Flyers fucking suck.
328807707_390980342040899584 x	Zolnierczyk has been a Penguin long enough to pick up the art of the dive apparently.
328807707_390979375673253888 x	Can you imagine how many more goals we'd have let up so far this season with Bryz instead of Mason? It would be hundreds. HUNDREDS.
328807707_390977652930015232 x	There is not a rivalry in sports as genuinely full of hate as the #Flyers and #Penguins. Fuck you, Western PA. Fuck. You.
328807707_390863832328851456 x	@RobTornoe How about one where he's a better quarterback than Vick and Foles combined?
