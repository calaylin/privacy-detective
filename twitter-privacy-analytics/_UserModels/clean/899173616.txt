899173616_391043692041363456 x	"Flyers should trade all their good players!" - my timeline right now
899173616_391044945802723328 x	@NHLFlyersHockey This town does love to blame the best players for team shortcomings.  Abreu, Carter/Richards, McNabb, etc
899173616_391045801839165440 x	@NHLFlyersHockey Gotta love revisionist history.  My fav is "Giroux just doesn't care!"  Yeah that's it, thanks Dr. Phil
899173616_391170097726771200 x	@ManOfAllSteins @NHLFlyersHockey I see a bad team that shouldn't trade the few skilled players it has
899173616_391234930920808448 x	@ManOfAllSteins @NHLFlyersHockey I think you're exaggerating just a bit here
899173616_391244485281079296 x	@ManOfAllSteins @NHLFlyersHockey I think he's a PPG player, but most of his points are assists & his teammates can't hit the net right now
899173616_391256657038413824 x	@ManOfAllSteins @NHLFlyersHockey He made Hartnell a 37-goal scorer in 2012, made Voracek a PPG guy last year. Don't overreact to 8 games.
