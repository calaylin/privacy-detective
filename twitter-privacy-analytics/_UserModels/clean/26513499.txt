26513499_392677565522931712 x	@AnandKopite apparently you haven't read other quotes, one chapter in a book != obsession :D
26513499_392680785779515392 x	@AnandKopite his name is enough for it to become bestseller. Ofcourse LFC would be highlighted because of the rivalry,but 'obsession' LOL!!
26513499_392682830880182273 x	@AnandKopite He gave his honest opinion (and he is right), he said the same about Becks. Still can't see how's that an 'obsession'.
26513499_392685643874058240 x	@AnandKopite and how exactly is 'Lampard' point related to obsession with liverpool part?
26513499_392690062665601024 x	@AnandKopite haha, we all can see who is bitter. No one expected a dull, diplomatic autobiography from Sir Alex being the that person he is
26513499_392691112827039744 x	@AnandKopite attention seeker LOL..check the meaning of word 'Autobiography'
26513499_392693976186114048 x	@AnandKopite As I said, I don't care what you think of him, it's your opinion, just as his are in his book.I only questioned 'obsessed' part
26513499_392694886542999552 x	@AnandKopite LFC have always been our greatest rivals, City were nothing few years ago. Only those who are new to football think otherwise
26513499_392707082664677377 x	@AnandKopite To have a whole chapter about the team you knocked off the perch is not called obsession (maybe according to scouse logic)
26513499_392708685023023104 x	@AnandKopite irony meter just exploded, you lot don't give a fuck about united yet you get wound up by his comments?? Geez I give up!!
26513499_392711641579540480 x	@AnandKopite so you assumed whole book is about obsession with liverpool by reading just few quotes? Seriously?? this is stupid, gud nite
