35944928_390125061837180928 x	@VaughnMJohnson man, I?m hyped. I?ve been playing the hell out of WWE 13 lately. Can?t wait for the new one.
35944928_390126012857868288 x	@VaughnMJohnson it really is. I just got and have been playing 13 nonstop since Friday. It?s ?research? for a story I?m working on about THQ
35944928_390127137405276160 x	@VaughnMJohnson (that?s just the excuse I?m using to explain away my horrible video game addiction to my gf)
35944928_388725998180913152 x	@VaughnMJohnson you gonna be at the house show on Sunday?
35944928_387048938827972608 x	@VaughnMJohnson I'm a new fan but I kinda liked the ending! I don't really care about Orton or Bryan, but Big Show can do no wrong!
35944928_387054676644204545 x	@VaughnMJohnson Big Show is literally the only guy in the WWE that I know enough about for that to have worked for me though.
35944928_387021706390667264 x	@VaughnMJohnson sweet pink gloves too
35944928_382876621398896640 x	Yo, @phillysport has a wrestling blog run by my dude @VaughnMJohnson. Check it out and give him a follow.
35944928_382881414896975872 x	@VaughnMJohnson it's not really my thing, but I kinda dig how the shows have to flow and how performers have to sell the writers' material
35944928_390171652278874112 x	Crowdsourcing: I'm looking for Philly-based wedding photographers... and DJs too, I guess. Any suggestions?
35944928_390181618628820992 x	@mollyeichel Awesome. Thank you so much. Seriously.
35944928_392659758802804736 x	I don't drink much anymore. I feel like shit today. Goddamn.
35944928_387248378989780992 x	Do you guys remember this #oldmeme? http://t.co/k9GyCeLtUo
35944928_391296396164624385 x	making fun of buzzfeed? wow you?re edgy.
35944928_391296614167351296 x	@SpikeEskin yeah I?m grumpy. that might be the best course of action.
35944928_391296790349500417 x	@SpikeEskin it?s just such low hanging fruit is all. I dunno.
35944928_422139841368059904 x	@PPDJoeMurray do you have data to back up your claims here joe
35944928_422141821016608768 x	@PPDJoeMurray oh I guess I missed that
35944928_419494976469602304 x	I just saw @PPDJoeMurray walking around South Philly in Saints gear. That?s weird, I thought he was an Eagles fan?
35944928_419087634066325504 x	My street hasn?t been touched by plows yet. I imagine the rest of South Philly must be a mess too.
35944928_419090709644591104 x	@SpikeEskin @alexrolfe I think he was talking specifically about the city. And, yknow, probably joking a bit.
35944928_423614195662598144 x	I apologize if I didn?t make it abundantly clear before now that American Hustle is one of my new favorite movies of all time.
