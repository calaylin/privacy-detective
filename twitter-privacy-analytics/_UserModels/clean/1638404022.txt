1638404022_387900946925514752 x	@WIPMorningShow is this a sports talk show or just a talk show?
1638404022_387900521115570176 x	@WIPMorningShow only reporter not kissing the @NHLFlyers ass. Berube is an asshole. This ships gonna sink before it leaves the dock.
1638404022_387762638803173376 x	@BroadStBull great. Rosehill plays like an asshole and Berube gives an asshole response. We're in great hands.
1638404022_387762375904206848 x	@sbaickerCSN No time for G to get confident. Being paid like elite player time to play like one. Cry about confidence later.
1638404022_387756424899878912 x	@tpanotchCSN when's this team gonna get their shit together? 5 min maj and barely any SOG? @28CGiroux needs to start earning that C
1638404022_387753694475063298 x	@CSNPhilly stop showing Berube. The cow behind him is distracting me from watching this game.
1638404022_387752731710341120 x	@Nhlflyers Gubransom nearly kills Hartnell and nobody retaliates. Then they cross check schenn with no retaliation. Show some damn fire.
1638404022_387752058855895040 x	@NHLFlyers god this team is bad. 5 min maj and they got maybe 4 shots on goal... C'mon....
1638404022_387372544325865472 x	@tpanotchCSN what did the Chief do to earn a two year deal as a head coach?
1638404022_387323841997189120 x	Oh Howie great story! That's awesome cuz! Chip told you about a play while at Oregon? Wow. C'mon @AnthonyLGargano quick kissin Howies ass
1638404022_387320535379886080 x	@GlenMacnow you give that hack of a caller Cowboy Dave and dbag booologist 3+ minutes but give my boy @bertol18 30 secs. C'mon bro!
1638404022_385796473566527488 x	@NHLFlyers @Oshawa_Generals @PhantomsHockey this team is a damned joke.
1638404022_385593467235475456 x	Same old @NHLFlyers issues. No offense, no defense. Recipe for a loss.
1638404022_385592865491259393 x	Pretty sure Timmonens old enough to collect social security and a free walker from medicaid
1638404022_385592249863929856 x	Waldo was easier to find on the ice tonight than the captain Girwho. #flyers
1638404022_384820274098888704 x	@Phillies if you were truly thankful you would give the city a decent product on the field and not the junk you threw out this year.
1638404022_375620084620070912 x	... The government paying your utility bills.
1638404022_375619964432302080 x	This generation is fucked. Growing up with 2nd place trophies and ribbons because you showed up. Free obamaphones and ...
1638404022_375617612786728961 x	Get out of the damn welfare line. Stop wasting your money on cigarettes and booze. Go find a damn job. Lazy.
1638404022_375616142116917248 x	You don't want to work on yourself.
1638404022_375616110068240384 x	Ain't nothing free in life. Earn every penny. Sweat, blood, tears, time and energy. That's what it takes. Stop asking for a handout cause
1638404022_375615850616983552 x	If I'm a CEO I'm protesting your r?sum?. But I can afford to cause I'm a CEO worked my ass off to better myself and earn what I have.
1638404022_375615266979610624 x	@PaulB9585 I agree whole heartedly w/ @Webster614 instead of protesting Walmart today go out and Find a better job. Sign up for a new class
1638404022_371517682966745089 x	Sandberg blows at press conferences.
1638404022_371516834324811777 x	Hey Ryno, did you win the game? No, then it doesn't matter if you came back from 7-1.
1638404022_371515678102016000 x	@Phillies congrats on the longest game in team history... I'd have rather had all 4 wisdom teeth pulled at once than watch this junk.
1638404022_371514232887443457 x	17 innings... 12 measly hits. @Phillies you guys blow.
1638404022_371514152247771136 x	Hey Ryno, next time save some pitchers for the late innings.
1638404022_363112737993273345 x	@Phillies Fans didnt come her for this RAJ. Thanks for wasting our money. Hopefully the owners fire your ass at seasons end. This team blows
