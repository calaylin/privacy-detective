15285457_394486998221598720 x	@Al_DeLaurentis @billmeltzer @TheOrangeUpdate They probably could, but it's better for him to play 1st line in AHL
15285457_394488425350324224 x	@Al_DeLaurentis @billmeltzer @TheOrangeUpdate They could recall Ben Holmstrom and use him, Talbot & Hall/Rinaldo on 4th line
15285457_392626465574895616 x	@sbaickerCSN @PearlJam Yeah, that really sucks...Indifference as a closing number? That looked like an interesting set list.
15285457_392627796012728320 x	@sbaickerCSN @PearlJam I should have blown off my family obligations & gone to the shows...Divorce can't be that expensive
15285457_392380312920928256 x	Despite the ominous feeling of a vote of confidence, I suspect that Holmgren's staying Flyers GM until the end of the season.
15285457_392381079224471552 x	@sbaickerCSN That's the other part of it, you have his successor in place, let him hang back and evaluate everything & everyone
15285457_394940519857393664 x	@CoverThePuck The time to pursue him is in the summer, if Mason falters, not now.
