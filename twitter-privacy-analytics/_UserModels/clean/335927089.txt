335927089_304116951851077636 x	@ErykaWashington they should have shown him the door... end of story
335927089_303587873398083586 x	@DNFlyers @broadsthockey they both take a back seat to the San Diego Chicken.. the best of all time..

335927089_293882383197933570 x	@JohnKincade I don't have a problem with Jerry forcing the move.. Garrett on notice.. as he should be..hasn't improved at all
335927089_292449133036453888 x	@achs_fred besides the obvious...your goalie is too slow reading the play
335927089_291740237707763713 x	@JohnKincade if Chip Kelly lasts 14 years in Philly with 5 championship games, one SB appearance.. no SB wins.. I am ok with that, haha
335927089_290586903684730882 x	@The_ChrisMyers I would agree with the statement if they did not take the lead.. once they took a lead, they did overcome it..
335927089_290584813956657153 x	@The_ChrisMyers they had the lead with 30 seconds left..so it wasn't too big of a hole to climb out of..

335927089_284776344850673664 x	@aliciavitarelli @shirleenallicot Shirleen only appreciates viewers thru the camera..ignorant in person.. I won't watch that fake smile
335927089_281265251155070976 x	@BoopStats lol... This was the one the day after the Flyers first exhibition game in Sept 2001.. Headline was "God Bless America"
335927089_281264525548875776 x	@SheenaParveen heard you sing today.. glad to see you aren't perfect, lol...
