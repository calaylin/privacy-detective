23339260_389831011343040512 x	Happy Joe Girardi's birthday to everyone. Also, to a much lesser extent, Stephen A. Smith, Jim Rome, and Floyd Landis
23339260_388477186774024193 x	@rileysteele11 I'm getting the Wharton shirt. Slytherin!!!!!!!!!!
23339260_388478116529598465 x	@rileysteele11 I'll take that as a challenge
23339260_388481048012521472 x	@rileysteele11 @run_IMW @JohnPhilMLU you don't even know Holden's name? And they would have to kill for my spot, cuz I won't relinquish it
23339260_374184239245557760 x	@JohnPhilMLU @ivybball the team could be really solid defensively and that miles and Fran have been underrated
23339260_374188321787764736 x	@JohnPhilMLU @ivybball yup, it is easy to question the lineup that Jerome Allen puts out there (although Jamal does provide solid defense)
23339260_374189294812155904 x	@ivybball @JohnPhilMLU awesome, let us know when you do. I like the preseason analysis though
