1955336431_390672823850528768 x	@SwaggyMitch it depends. They have a young team. Nene and some of the older guys have to develop the rookies
1955336431_390674354520203264 x	@SwaggyMitch john wall has injury problems bro, didn't you watch last season
1955336431_390677020868243457 x	@SwaggyMitch but they have free agency and the trade deadline. Not like they are gonna have the same players forever. Smh -_-
1955336431_390678583074889728 x	@SwaggyMitch @Winless4Wiggins I say 76ers get 24 wins. They may shock a few teams like Miami or okc
