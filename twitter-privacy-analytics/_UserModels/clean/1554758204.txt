1554758204_391558979144650752 x	This might be the best year ever to be a terrible NBA team. Talent is there
1554758204_390671793138454530 x	.@Sportswriter22 you think both Wiggins and Parker will go to Washington??
1554758204_390679116435193856 x	.@Sportswriter22 @SwaggyMitch that's not good though. That's what I'm thinking, but we're not a good team like you think we are
1554758204_396459290707632128 x	.@OffthemarkRoca I'm not saying Wiggins will be as good as LeBron. But don't say he's all hype just because other people say it
1554758204_396462294764638208 x	.@YouWant2KnowMe @OffthemarkRoca yeaah, he is....
1554758204_395692586369052672 x	We're trending though guys!!!!!! http://t.co/zNVqHnEOdN

1554758204_394931781142839296 x	Khalif Wyatt will apparently play in China this year
1554758204_393108411627614209 x	.@JimboSlice0910 #WHOP @MCW1 @TWroten_LOE @KhalifW05 @Vander13lue
1554758204_392473823410675714 x	Focus on rehabbing and putting on muscle this season @NerlensNoel3. No rush #WinlessForWiggins
1554758204_384498504774975488 x	Remember a few years ago when everyone made fun of the NFC West and how bad they were? That's us now
1554758204_396458445584748544 x	Maybe we should root for Flyers losses and Sixers wins and things will reverse and go the way we want
1554758204_395732908050505728 x	That was so fun
1554758204_395731560919732224 x	MARCUS CARTER-WILLIAMS HAHAHAHAHAHA I LOVE IT @marcuscwilliams
1554758204_395723343091232768 x	Here come the people saying we'll win a title this year lol
1554758204_395721114217091072 x	@troyweller I wanted this win lol
1554758204_395721751101186048 x	.@troyweller did you really think I was literal by saying "Winless" for Wiggins?
1554758204_395721307528396801 x	MC DUB YOU ARE MY FAVORITE SIXER THIS YEAR

1554758204_391927255737573376 x	Nice day for a tailgate
1554758204_391032749517471744 x	Looks like we have an early winner. Shout out to @EvilEdSnider for the inspiration http://t.co/cuiO7Bp0jD

1554758204_396454078936797184 x	Looks like these shirts might not be happening. Too bad, the money would've gone to a good cause in Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philly
1554758204_394920855735910401 x	We've reached 2,000! 1,500 more than my original preseason goal. I'd like to thank all of you, this is only the beginning #WinlessForWiggins
1554758204_384465385720147968 x	.@36westbrook is a very good analyst. Great addition to Eagles postgame show
1554758204_398585629296308224 x	I really love Chooch, but if the Rockies actually offered 3 years $28 million, I'm not sure if I would match that....
1554758204_397526260584546304 x	DeSean Jackson in the building!
1554758204_396455047825203200 x	.@BIG_tym101 who's going to buy it? I'm not having them made for 10 people
1554758204_399384696389664768 x	.@RoobCSN ...losses too. We want an actual contender, not a perennial early playoff exit/9 seed
1554758204_399395788549537792 x	.@WiffleBall1 @RoobCSN @Ronniep145 anyone who thinks that I thought that pro WOULD throw games is an idiot. Obviously they want to win
1554758204_399397205158952960 x	.@WiffleBall1 @RoobCSN @Ronniep145 if you followed me, you'd see that I'd us to win, but I'm content with losses
1554758204_398273149361737728 x	I think the Sixers should wear bowling uniforms instead of their usual warmups on Friday to welcome in Bynum
1554758204_398271358486192128 x	Kevin Ware is playing tonight. That's amazing
1554758204_397858572874563584 x	Will anyone be at there Friday for the Return of Andrew Bynum?
1554758204_397529543847985152 x	MCW starting to turn the ball over like I thought he would this season...  Remember, he's still a rookie
1554758204_397537384235270144 x	.@Leem20Philly215 I'm good
1554758204_397541090557181952 x	.@Leem20Philly215 @CreaseCreator do you want to have mid-round draft picks and no playoffs/early exits for the next 10 years?
1554758204_397543203429416960 x	@phillytokorea @Leem20Philly215 @CreaseCreator you don't remember the second half/playoffs of last year? Curry is a beast
1554758204_397189928863674368 x	Looks like the Suns are going to lose, but they stuck with the Thunder the entire game. Another overachieving team so far
1554758204_397191676244271104 x	@phillytokorea let's wait until the first month is over to make assumptions. Too early to make any judgements
1554758204_400476650141646848 x	Please stop with the  Winless For Parker tweets to me lol
1554758204_394936967873691649 x	Alright guys, please stop copying @MarcusBarkleyQB's idea now
1554758204_394924123887247360 x	So, @MVFive what do you think of @MarcusBarkleyQB?
1554758204_394906712739958785 x	I'd actually love to see Tebow come to Philly for the rest of the year. Let's at least be entertained if we're going to be bad
1554758204_394923095427125249 x	#LetsMakeItAwkward @MarcusTebow @MarcusBarkleyQB @MVFive
1554758204_394909131666382848 x	If @MarcusBarkleyQB followed me, my life would be made. Probably my favorite twitter account right now lol
1554758204_396067788974198784 x	Just an FYI: I won't be able to watch the game tomorrow night
1554758204_395702435869908992 x	1 point lead now.  Are we back to #WinlessForWiggins now?
1554758204_394935049461985280 x	PROTECTED
1554758204_395691788553711616 x	What if I only made this account so the Sixers would do the opposite of what we want?
1554758204_395593506624110592 x	@Winless4Mariota really? Who was it and what did they say?
1554758204_395330870166695938 x	We're getting @ChipKellysBalls to 2,000 followers tonight. FOLLOW HIM
1554758204_395310255057686528 x	IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: here's my shoutout on @SportsCenter today (about 2:30 into the video) http://t.co/uAALLg4OAV
1554758204_395298146517270530 x	@tha_funk @NatalieEgenolf @Winless4Mariota and I think the Jags have him locked up
1554758204_395291807447543808 x	I see @NatalieEgenolf is on board with @winless4mariota, how about #WinlessForWiggins? https://t.co/OMmcDlzCqj
