20579451_386532896120782848 x	Temple blows. I'm so sick of thinking this team is building something.
20579451_380893803730993152 x	Who didn't see that coming? Billie Davis that's who
20579451_380872337744465921 x	Well - offensive line looks bad, Vick holding onto the ball to long, Chip getting out schemed, and McCoy is hurt? I miss anything?
20579451_386935639683633153 x	Does Nick Foles score anymore points?
20579451_386948596761100288 x	The Foles people will be unbearable this week.
20579451_394694059249655808 x	Lisa Turtle brought nothing to the show.
20579451_394314996995620864 x	He dove for the call. Did Joyce want him to magically float out of the base path?
20579451_398978691859886080 x	@EziosVengeance where are you seeeing this?
20579451_398005722916864001 x	@EziosVengeance link?
20579451_398009995641778176 x	@EziosVengeance they never honor that shit. Just gonna cancel it tomorrow on ya
20579451_397200920939073536 x	I'll be the minority this week, but those 7 TDs by Foles didn't blow me away. Oakland's secondary played horrible all game long.
20579451_397202312969871360 x	@EziosVengeance guys were wide open all day. He played well but it wasn't lets not draft a QB next year well enough
20579451_333258021843128320 x	Would you rather have Chase Utley or Ryan Howard for the next 4 years?
20579451_394263114361090048 x	My hatred for Penn State grows daily.
20579451_399712011455832064 x	We're the most immature fan base in the world. We've been told what it means 2b a Philly fan 4years. Exactly how many rings has that got us?
20579451_399715211223244801 x	@redschmidt27 we take pride in booing, which is bs.
20579451_399712650227359744 x	And all of tomorrow all we will hear is how much of a "jackass" DeSean is for telling the truth.
20579451_385845420762882048 x	The horror! ?@JasonLaCanfora: Thinking out loud here, I can't help wondering if Andy Reid might be just the guy to polish up Josh Freeman?
20579451_380752006807556096 x	Is anybody else's battery life terrible after updating to iOS 7?
20579451_356215189995126784 x	@darrenrovell completely not fair. Fans couldn't get into the game because it was a double header and a rain delay
20579451_394621354957627392 x	Hear me out before you call me crazy. Chip knew Vick was hurt and sent him out there anyway bc he could care less about Vick's career.
20579451_394623699418365952 x	@SpartansFan09 interesting take. Hasn't thought about it that way
20579451_270231132187017217 x	our silver lining playbook says reid is gone tomorrow.
20579451_265635909268017153 x	Vick's brother is demanding a trade for Mike. I've seen it all now
20579451_250221390605721600 x	I love you Philly, but it was one game against a very good team. We're still 2-1 and in 1st place in the NFC East. Lets not get carried away
20579451_391689488738430976 x	Is there anybody in football right now college or pro that's more fun to watch than Johnny Football?
