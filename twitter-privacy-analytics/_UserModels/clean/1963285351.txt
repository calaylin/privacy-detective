1963285351_394526574562652160 x	Congratulations Mike Vick. You made an awful giants defense look all world #goodluckwithanewcontract
1963285351_394522212482293760 x	Lemme guess, Vick is bad right now because of 2 things. 1. The offensive line. 2. He's still hurt and trying to play. #quittheexcuses

1963285351_391910910433824769 x	@PatGallen_975 @975TheFanatic 31-27 #birds. No pass rush so far but I think 3+ sacks rattles Romo into a T/O. Xtra possession wins the game.
