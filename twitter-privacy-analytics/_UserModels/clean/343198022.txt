343198022_172887205671481346 x	@tpanotchCSN - do not agree - I think LA would take JVR for Brown in a minute. Much greater upside for team that needs scoring.PHI wouldn't.

343198022_110746129058111488 x	Why do you enjoy busting on Phillies fans? Is it because you can't bust on the Braves "fans" - who show up as empty seats each game?
