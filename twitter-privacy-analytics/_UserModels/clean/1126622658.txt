1126622658_362185738114187266 x	@Espngreeny mcnabb had no wr's for his career. Todd stinkston James Trash, reggie brown freddie mitchell? The ONE yr he had T.O. Superbowl
1126622658_362184906664714240 x	@WIPMorningShow hes a bafoon w his comments but he was a hell of a qb for this city and under appreciated

1126622658_350192293560582144 x	@WIPAfternoons flyers arent goin to resign Read so hes def trade bait. If a trade involves schenn or couturier this city will kill Homer
1126622658_350191603316555776 x	@WIPAfternoons yandle might take Read n another player... Weber if available id trade Read, Laughton, Mezjaros n draft picks if needed

1126622658_350190779974680577 x	@WIPAfternoons the one trade i wouldnt have done was Richards, but even that got Schenn n Simmonds who r 2 great players for the next 10yrs
1126622658_350190388704845824 x	@WIPAfternoons bobrovsky is hurting, but they went out n got the goalie w very good numbers but stunk here... The flyers at least always try
1126622658_350190033195634689 x	@WIPAfternoons also JVR, Homer gave him 5 yrs to develop n didnt, him n Kane drafted 1 n 2 yet Kane has 2 cups n a superstar. Jvr superstar?
1126622658_350189412312825856 x	@WIPAfternoons flyers have made some bonehead moves but i would have done them too. Carter was injury prone n did nothing in the playoffs
