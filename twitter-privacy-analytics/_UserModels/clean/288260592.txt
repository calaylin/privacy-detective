288260592_394483685770399744 x	@The_Hof14 there 3 quarter backs in the nfl with better numbers than Andy Dalton in the last 3 weeks. So yeah he is nice.
288260592_394503680021372930 x	@The_Hof14 and I guarantee andy dalton has more playoff wins than Romo when he's 33!! Romo is trash man, overrated always has been
288260592_394551716370075648 x	@The_Hof14 so that logic is extremely flawed my man.
