114866624_350133251450470400 x	We have runs. Utley and Brown score on a double error by Padres second baseman Logan Forsythe. Phils up 7-5 in 13th. Papelbon warming.
114866624_350124081728860160 x	As a Padres writer pointed out to us, Huston Street has allowed 10 home runs in 26 1/3 innings this season.
114866624_354761089369653249 x	How many Phillies players say "For The Love of The Game" is their favorite baseball movie? Way too many.
114866624_369142318621667328 x	Someone is trying to tell me that Ryan Howard right now has the same value Jim Thome had when they traded him. Stop.

114866624_354762292354744321 x	@whereskernan @KevinCooney @DennisDeitch not even sure it's overrated. I didn't think anyone thought it was good. Until 3-4 Phillies players
114866624_369136424349466624 x	Mayberry was Amaro's first acquisition as GM. He would have fit in better with the dreadful Phillies teams of the Felske/Elia/Leyva years.
114866624_396295578424188928 x	That sure doesn't look like Mike Trout. Huh. RT @jachobe: Just got a pic with a best player in baseball!!unreal!! http://t.co/SK23NuI9GC
114866624_396296518850068481 x	@T0mmyo uh, ok. Best hitter, sure. Not best baseball player. Not close either.
114866624_396303175244058624 x	@T0mmyo yes, ignoring base running and fielding is not absurd. Gotcha.
114866624_396307476339228672 x	@T0mmyo right. Great, great hitter. One of best ever. But u said baseball player. Total package.
114866624_396310589230039040 x	@T0mmyo no, I don't believe it is. Fittingly you didn't list best overall player: Willie Mays.
114866624_396312795102584833 x	@T0mmyo original point had nothing to do with historical context. Best player in baseball. Right now. 99 out of 100 people would say Trout.
114866624_396314071915835392 x	@T0mmyo I can't go on any further. It's going in circles. Best hitter, yes. Hitting is not the totality of a baseball player. That's all.
114866624_372910609991737344 x	And we head to the bottom of the ninth inning with Train playing over the Citi Field speakers. #Train

114866624_122519397947539457 x	It's an Achilles injury for Ryan Howard. Won't know more until MRI. #Phillies
114866624_122498839264497664 x	The Phanatic is right behind the dugout. Perhaps he will grab a bat?
114866624_122486320214966272 x	Pence has hit one ball out of the infield in the last two games.
114866624_122489174224928769 x	@jbohenn nah, Werth produced in the postseason. Tied for franchise record in postseason HRs.
114866624_112996345845006336 x	#Phillies lose 3-2. Magic Number to win division down to 6, however, since Braves lost. Also, can't see Bowker on a playoff roster.

114866624_364197827850674177 x	Darin Ruf has reached base in 32 consecutive games, it's the longest active streak in the major leagues.
114866624_339198921656107010 x	That's the second time Howard has broke for third on a ball to short in last four nights. This time, he gets caught. Not smart base running.
114866624_235173757474455552 x	John Mayberry Jr. snapped an 0-for-15 skid with that double.
114866624_230813274512449536 x	Everybody is a candidate to play third base next year. Even Cole Hamels.

114866624_217060606107324416 x	His $21.5 million is most any Phillie will make in 2012. RT @jakemkaplan: RT @RobMaaddi: Lee remains winless since 9-26-11 --- 273 days ago.
114866624_217053891366363136 x	Huh. Tiny, little shove by Pence on Rays catcher there makes him stumble a bit, allows Polly to get to third.
114866624_217051644569980928 x	Sean Rodriguez was the runner. He had the entire inside line to the plate wide open. Odd. It's like he sought out contact.
114866624_216304918913495040 x	Pretty sure one of the pennant flags will fly away in the next 10 minutes. I have money on '77.
114866624_207633746898329600 x	wait. he's still in there? RT @davidhaletnj: that time you look up in the 6th inning & realize Joe Blanton is still pitching for some reason

114866624_397518522785755136 x	@EziosVengeance revere isn't guaranteed anything. They could get two OF and a C. That's 3/8ths of lineup.

114866624_391774183241175040 x	Shane Victorino DID hit the game-tying HR before Stairs' go-ahead HR back in the '08 NLCS, in case people forgot. (Yes, and slam off CC)
114866624_364185064315174912 x	@KevinCooney wait. you didn't even know who they were a half hour ago. this does not add up.
114866624_309290841397141505 x	Delmon Young already back in camp. Just took a bat to the cage, so that's a good sign I guess. Should be an update later.
114866624_395360031694405632 x	Does Reverend Lovejoy play for the Ducks??
114866624_379301918826594305 x	The Phillies will face "Dyson" and "Flynn" in the next two days. If you can tell me their first names without looking it up, you win a prize
