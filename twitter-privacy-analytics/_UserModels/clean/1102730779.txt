1102730779_392952780228689920 x	@boone_andrew get over it! If he would have killed a person u would hav forgiven him by now! Ridiculous
1102730779_393127721725087744 x	@boone_andrew all I'm sayin is, u shud respect him for trying to lead a better life , not necessarily more than anyone else
1102730779_393178912785969152 x	@boone_andrew your point is a good one. I guess my thinking is ppl shud respect the players who do PEDS  a whole lot less than Vick
1102730779_393192059227897856 x	@boone_andrew I have a question.  If both are healthy who do u think shud start, Vick or Foles?
1102730779_394198504891219969 x	@mccue_dawn yes it was
