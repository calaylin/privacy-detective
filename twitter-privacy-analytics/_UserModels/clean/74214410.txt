74214410_388128995587289088 x	Hahaha! So lemme get this straight... Hurdle won't move Pedro up in Game 5, but he will finally stop shifting on Holliday? OK.
74214410_388130569080414208 x	@conshydane Hurdle has made a half dozen terrible decisions in this series. I'd like to see what we could do if we had a decent manager.
74214410_388131073537753088 x	@conshydane Probably right.
74214410_386234708280881152 x	@conshydane I don't believe the owner of my team cares about trying to win a WS. He just wants to be good enough to turn a profit.
74214410_386235620621709312 x	@conshydane Definitely, but spending tons of money with the risk of losing in the DS or CS is scary for a man who loves his money.
74214410_386236487227801600 x	@conshydane Well if that crowd for the Reds game didn't show them how much money they could make, nothing will.
74214410_386228790126317568 x	@conshydane Well I'm sure I argued that you were wrong, but I'm happy I was. Still don't have a crazy amount of faith, but more than I did.
74214410_386232204642115584 x	@conshydane We traded our last power hitting 3B, Aramis, after just 1 year of paying his arbitration deal.
74214410_386231826156503040 x	@conshydane Yeah, we'll get that answer after this season. Pedro is eligible for Arbitration after a 36/100 season.
