930958909_270266511480987648 x	@Espngreeny cruel and unusual punishment. It's like a bad car accident. I can't turn away. I'm an #Eagles fan but they need to end this now!
930958909_270264655098826755 x	@EaglesInsider the problem is they also have to stop the Skins on > than 1 yard possessions too.

930958909_267789075019358208 x	Thanks the memories Big Red. But it's time for a new start. The sideline just looks stale. #Eaglestalk
930958909_267778518425931776 x	@stephenasmith that was a good pass and a bad drop. I'll still take Sunshine over Vick.
