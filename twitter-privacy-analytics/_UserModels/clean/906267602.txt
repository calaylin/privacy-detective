906267602_385945116533592064 x	@RalphyHeraldSun @Kingclivemc it can't count in cap unless the AFL has the most poorly designed cap system in the world!
906267602_385945598933094400 x	@RalphyHeraldSun @Kingclivemc how can a club be on hook for a guys salary if he quits/retires? No American or other leagues have such rules.
906267602_385759829140455424 x	@ralphyheraldsun In no company or sports league in the world does an employee get paid out on a contract if they retire or walk out on it...
906267602_385760207030472704 x	@ralphyheraldsun Mark Finnis confirmed this on SEN today?why are you pushing this point? If Bud retires after 5 yrs he won't get last 4 rs.

906267602_385020734135103488 x	@martinj_blake funny how this topic only came up when swans win flag....if it good enough for them when they suck its goes the other way.
906267602_385020480924950528 x	@martinj_blake what a dhead Eddie is. He knows they don't have extra cap money but a 9.8% loading on each contract right? He is so dishonest
906267602_385019697869369344 x	@RalphyHeraldSun @jt_or_grabba it's so funny how uneducated people are on how this 9.8% works. The afl knows exactly how it works!
906267602_385019263066841088 x	@RalphyHeraldSun @jt_or_grabba idiots. Get educated. That is what already happen!!! There is 9.8% added to each contract. Know the facts!
906267602_385018459958292480 x	@Robbo_heraldsun swans are the masters of working an under the radar deal and managing cap better than anyone-what a list they now have!

906267602_384888661265117184 x	@rooster28 @RalphyHeraldSun agreed Craig.Why all the outrage in recent years? Only 1 thing has changed.Swans a top team so now COLA must go?
906267602_384887848446742528 x	@RalphyHeraldSun @superfooty love it... Boy are their some sour grapes around. Where was all this angry 10 years ago people?
906267602_384884687174643712 x	@ClarkyHeraldSun @Robbo_heraldsun just real lazy journalism that if the swans pull this massive recruitment thar the convo is about COLA.
906267602_384884292436131840 x	@ClarkyHeraldSun @Robbo_heraldsun why? Because Sydney manage their cap better than anyone ? Swans make 100k profit a year in that market max
906267602_384883592251572224 x	@RalphyHeraldSun all awful articles with zero good reasons why it should be removed. Swans make 100k a year if lucky in that market!
906267602_384883136863408128 x	@RalphyHeraldSun only hear about when they out recruit  melb  club and their presidents cry about it & the fact that they are elite team now
906267602_384882570078728192 x	@RalphyHeraldSun that's the rules..... Jesus, until they are different shut up with this COLA. Swans have had it for decades!
906267602_384882023095349248 x	@craighutchy @martinj_blake it's such an easy lazy bitch by rival clubs to point at COLA as to why swans recruit well.
906267602_384881052646637568 x	@craighutchy @martinj_blake agreed hutch. Swans don't cheat. They play within rules and do it as well as anyone! People need to stop crying!
906267602_384880339069718528 x	@abcgrandstand @GerardWhateley hey idiots. Go research the swans players payments before U start making uneducated comments...u look dumb!
906267602_384878737273389056 x	@SENfooty hey dip shits...teams need to learn how to manage their cap and shot bitching when Sydney manages theirs well! Stop crying!
906267602_384878086485192704 x	@RalphyHeraldSun ps: good luck beating them if they stay healthy with buddy.

906267602_383963462206242816 x	@rohan_connolly that's fair Rohan. Swans season derailed my killer injuries. Would love to see a full strength Sydney vs hawks minus buddy.
906267602_383959689262034944 x	@rohan_connolly awful Rohan! Hawks played better game last year wen thy lost GF! Freo couldn't apply 4qtr pressure like swans last year.

906267602_381370932637745152 x	@RalphyHeraldSun odds never make sense Ralph. Last years GF was flip of coin with most pre game pundits picking swans but hawks were $1.40.
906267602_381347212653264896 x	@EWFiney_SEN go bloods! Hope your daughter is ready to cheer loud!!! Will be all-time upset if they win with all the talent out side.
906267602_380894396969140224 x	@RGIII @wingoz @donovanjmcnabb well said RG3! 5 was a great player!
906267602_380515838006423552 x	@rohan_connolly swans trying to make history by making a GF with their best 3 forwards and 3 of their best defenders all out. Massive ask.
906267602_379742943026106368 x	@MorningGlorySEN @RhysyB great man pikey. the swans have over 1/3 of their best 18 out, would this win be biggest prelim upset ever?
906267602_379443821278662656 x	@RalphyHeraldSun teddy laid a clean textbook shepherd....shows how soft the AFL has become.
906267602_376456067016036352 x	@Robbo_heraldsun Reid is not a forward !
906267602_376451111269728256 x	@rohan_connolly shut up all you collingwood fans... Try beating the team in front of u before predicting wins two weeks from now! Hot pies!

906267602_375022166393495552 x	@Vuash23 @afl one big error in this article. Swans have no swing man?? They have one of the best in the game but he is hurt, you forget LRT?
906267602_374696709630484480 x	@NMalceski_9 not till early October after back to back flags can you use these! Go luck Friday champ.
906267602_373442304935477249 x	@EWFiney_SEN love the show. Listen from USA every week! No team can win a flag with 6 of their best 18 not playing-that's the ask for swans!
906267602_373270746484994048 x	@McGlynn_21 @sydneyswans get the bloods back on track this week Bennie !
906267602_373264964607561729 x	@lithgowflashman @rohan_connolly with all the injuries the swans are simply a shell of their former self. They could be scary next year!
906267602_373264566035431424 x	@rohan_connolly @lithgowflashman a full strength swans could beat cats but 10 players from last years GF won't play tonight.
906267602_367014092508106753 x	@rohan_connolly it was awful viewing over here in the US Rohan ! Another meltdown by Aussies with a few shocker LBW decisions...
906267602_366197401352011777 x	@Robbo_heraldsun two good games robbo... Keep a lid on it! They lost to GC 3 weeks ago!

906267602_364129578459357184 x	@Robbo_heraldsun robbo -  yet another standout performance from your man captain K Jack, has he looked up All-Australian honors yet?
906267602_364018476215980032 x	@rohan_connolly one game, any team in AFL can play one pod game. Lets hope Melbourne media doesn't do their usual thing & start hyping pies
906267602_364017563434352640 x	@Stevo7AFL disgraceful commentary Stevo. Very unprofessional from a sports writer. Swans & GWS didn't break any rules. #sydmost$inworld
906267602_364016732270100482 x	@Stevo7AFL what a totally uneducated comment, swans managed cap well and unloaded some players to get Tippett & u call that unfair-pathetic!
906267602_362014755008937984 x	@RealSkipBayless agreed skip. 5 was one of top 3 QB's in the game during his prime years 2002-2008.
906267602_361681916610617344 x	@RalphyHeraldSun is there deeper list than swans? No Goodes, Jetta, LRT, Reid, Johnson, Shaw, McGlynn, Gary Rohan etc & still they roll
906267602_361583667589550080 x	@rohan_connolly Rohan is there deeper list than swans? No Goodes, Jetta, LRT, Reid, Johnson, Shaw, McGlynn, Gary Rohan etc & still they roll

906267602_360098434914586624 x	@fishmanohyeah @rohan_connolly agreed tony, way to many 50-50 games for dons to predict they only lose one more game the rest of the way.
906267602_360097043500376064 x	@rooster28 @rohan_connolly Ps Craig I agree. Dons might start fav but could trip up on a number of games on run home. Injuries swans concern
906267602_360096587491454977 x	@rohan_connolly @rooster28 nobody rates dons as elite team and everyone rates swans, Rohan u know Dons are only 2 pts ahead of swans right?
906267602_359141798079242240 x	@DennisDMZ totally agree Dennis!!
906267602_358999954288672771 x	@ChrisJay49 @martinj_blake give me a break chris.. What are u trying to say? Swans not elite team? They have half their team out right now..
906267602_359085306017882113 x	@ChrisJay49 understood didn't see your other tweets.
906267602_359020532089360385 x	@Robbo_heraldsun like: swans - half their best 18 out and you wouldn't know it! Suns & jr, great win for football! Dislike: pies - rebuild?
906267602_359002946479988737 x	@Stevo7AFL oh Ryan, how uneducated you really are! Do u need me to explain how the swans & GWS cost of living allowance is applied? #bitter

906267602_348940982026375168 x	@Espngreeny Danny green was finals MVP after 5 games of finals. LBJ is in prime of his career & that's how he played? #1greatgame=bestever?
906267602_348937292901138433 x	@Espngreeny the greatest player ever simply doesn't have a resume with the stains lebron does, period. MJ never disappeared like LBJ has.

906267602_348314069524168706 x	@WindhorstESPN Brian - LBJ one of the most clutch players ever?? Really? If MJ is the measuring stick this guy is way off the pace!
906267602_348198297766330368 x	@WallaceNBA_ESPN I bet those front running heat fans are lining up!!
906267602_348197351237754880 x	@RealSkipBayless yeah his greatest skip but first time he has scored more in one game than Jordan's avg of 33.6 in finals, what's that say?
906267602_348196284932423680 x	@ESPNSteinLine @ESPNStatsInfo really???? What an absolutely stupid stat!!!!! Who cares? How many game 7 finals games have the greats played?
906267602_348035224946491392 x	@Espngreeny ps: people are not haters, we just hate having LBJ jammed down our throat as best ever by ESPN.he will never be best ever period
906267602_348033452349718529 x	@Espngreeny he's the the best in today's game, If u think u are watching the greatest player ever than I am not are what to tell you.
906267602_347439144013815808 x	@LegsESP Legs -how could they miss that call on Manu with 2 secs left in OT? It was as clear as a foul as u will ever see!
906267602_347213858311634944 x	@RealSkipBayless agreed that guy can being playing great and then in clutch just  chokes up, those turnovers were not bad but awful.
906267602_347206136342122496 x	@jadande spurs just had title stolen from them.... Manu was clearly fouled! No questions about it. That is the title right there.
906267602_347205803494744066 x	@RealSkipBayless agrees skip... They just had the championship stolen from them with one of worst calls ever.

906267602_343714296167034880 x	@Robbo_heraldsun like: the swans! Simply awesome vs crows. Tippett, Reid, LRT, Jetta,Shaw to return-Back2back on the cards. Dis-goal review!
906267602_343431475665989632 x	@seamusbm @HornChris14 @MikeMiss975 couldn't agree more. God for bid you don't think LBJ is the greatest and the heat not a great team.

906267602_343016581409955840 x	@MikeMiss975 @tikimiki64 haha mikey miss is jacked up my LBJ's stat line. 18 huge pts and a bunch of defensive boards & zero 4th Q impact.
906267602_343016919005270016 x	@Vuash23 @mikemiss975 @tikimiki64 PS Mike does Lebron ever have anything to do with the Heat losing any game? Your Heat love is strange?
906267602_343009395380191232 x	@ESPN_Colin and so was the quality of all the open shots the spurs had and miss - whats your point Colin?
906267602_343008940486963200 x	@ESPN_Colin Leonard had nothing to do with Lebron scoring 18 its and keeping him out of his comfortable zone all night? #LBJnoMJneverwillbe
906267602_343008001717833728 x	@ESPN_Colin worked out well four them huh Colin? Lost to a team that shot 41% from the field in a game the heat role players showed up!

906267602_265105577968037889 x	@npomalley nick I can't believe the liberal bais trash you are feeding to the Aussies back home, that's a real shame!!!
906267602_265104920158543873 x	@chucktodd @meetthepress chuck &NBC, please answer elephant in room q. How are any of these polls correct unless we see 2008 turnout level?
906267602_265102743243476992 x	@npomalley paul I have serious q for you,do you really think obama has same turnout levels as 2008? If not all these polls are way off mark
906267602_265102030081753090 x	@BuzzFeedAndrew @mpoindc yes this poll is accurate if you believe obama gets get same turnout as 2008.....do you really think he will?
906267602_264023020958515200 x	@chucktodd Unless we see 08 turnout levels do you really think Obama can win? Romney is up with Indies and turnout looks way more 10 then 08
906267602_262907760126087168 x	@NumbersMuncher Romney up 15 with indies and +2 gender gap lead but only leading by 1? Romney is clearly leading by more than 1!!
906267602_261907051473678337 x	@jaketapper Also you are one of the only people on this story so my post is not directed towards you!
906267602_261906590557433856 x	@jaketapper  Jake please. Conservatives know the media are all over them so that is a given. Main stream media coverage of Libya is disgrace
906267602_261905711490035713 x	Is Obama's 'firewall' crumbling http://t.co/vb3kt0qs via @MailOnline
906267602_261868711084965888 x	@chucktodd How does O win? Huge flip in major KPIs from 08'.16% flip in indies to 08. Gender gap flipped big time also. GOP more excited etc
