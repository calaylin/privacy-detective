150774283_394849640514080768 x	@TKBlueshirt exactly, NYC is one of the business capitals of the world, it happens.
150774283_394850455148593152 x	@TKBlueshirt exactly, and if my job is going to ask me to work til 6 but also give me free tickets in the 100's I'm gonna say yes w/o doubt
150774283_394816027122745344 x	If you live/work in or near one of if not the most expensive city on earth don't complain about pricing for sporting events, it's given.

150774283_393048439443177474 x	@TKBlueshirt @stephennyr89 @BR19MG10 no, realignment forces us to look at the division.
150774283_393049054433017856 x	@TKBlueshirt @stephennyr89 @BR19MG10 top 3 from each division and 2 wild cards for each CONFERENCE
150774283_392837739395416064 x	It smells like snow ?????
150774283_391936829714604032 x	You know who needs a good goaltender, has a top 6 and a decent goaltender to give up?   Pittsburgh.
150774283_391701126191796224 x	WHERE. IS. SAM.
150774283_390562979802284032 x	In case you were curious caps fans are in fact, not louder than NYR fans. Their organization is also not as rich or historical as NYR so HA
150774283_390279336324239361 x	If I would've known last season was  going to end up how it did, I would've given Prust the $3M
150774283_390128439891861504 x	Somebody tell Vigneault that he cannot play the goalie games in NY that he did Vancouver there is ONE clear starter and that's it.
150774283_390130680367423488 x	@NYRangersZone I'm not entirely sure what he's doing. Back and forth between hank/Biron and now Biron is gone?
150774283_389778514297516032 x	Say hello to the new Madison Square Garden (notice the sky bridge) ??? #NYR http://t.co/i0vmKli6u5
150774283_389787516041428993 x	@TKBlueshirt monitor will probably be to replace the scoreboard. It seems that looking down towards the ice the view is fine
150774283_389788141152137216 x	@TKBlueshirt yea, but that could just be cause of the picture. I have no idea, I would have to be there
150774283_389787174302150656 x	why the HELL is Dorsett still on the team I'm so mad
