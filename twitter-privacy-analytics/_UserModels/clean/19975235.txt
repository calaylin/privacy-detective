19975235_396430881403183104 x	@NancyDoster88 @tapper let's play guess the attendance. Your estimate?
19975235_396077245527498752 x	@tapper @Neshaminy hey do you know if the game is sold out?
19975235_396263583610580992 x	@tapper just drove by school. Five sets of bleachers added, it appears.
19975235_394559431897133056 x	@tapper Clearly! Looking forward to playoffs. Not sure if I'll be in Fairless Hills. I take 1 for team on Fridays, shoot uncovered games.
19975235_394544190052651008 x	@tapper Well, you might in a week. #notoveryet
19975235_394551376514396160 x	@tapper oh you certainly can. And if not you might get another shot in the playoffs! #rivalryweek #itsabouttime
19975235_394554419104456704 x	@tapper agreed and thank goodness for this game. We actually have something legit to hype up on the show!
19975235_394555632956616705 x	@tapper That is good stuff! We will definitely use it. Interviewing Coach Schmidt on Tuesday for the show. What should I ask?
19975235_394557576442310656 x	@tapper good one. I'm kind of thinking Redskins, going for undefeated record, have more pressure on them than Pennsbury.
19975235_394558642613407744 x	@tapper That too. Also Schmidt has been pushing them hard to play a perfect game. I remember him screaming at 'em at Souderton.
