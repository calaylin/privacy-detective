43139414_348138156132024320 x	Ray Allen gave LeBron a legacy reprieve and did he ever seize the opportunity. Greatest game he ever played, finally hit big-game jumpers.
43139414_347206882101972992 x	LeBron did lot of good things in the paint in 4th q and OT but refs saved him from being the goat (instead of G.O.A.T.) w/ 3 late turnovers.

43139414_394650096286969856 x	The way Eddie Lacy freight-trains, he's going to have a terrific 3-year NFL career.
43139414_392030520369872896 x	Still like Barkley over Foles but he tried to make too much happen in his 1st NFL action and made 3 interceptions happen.

43139414_395724984552660992 x	LeBron (without DWade) leaves clutch gene in Miami, stinks up 4th q, allows Michael C-W led Sixers to roar from behind. Not MVP tonight.
43139414_385835312481456128 x	When Kareem prepped Gasol and Bynum to play DHoward in Finals, he said it was an EASY JOB. Said Lakers will not miss him. AGREE.

43139414_388032890656677889 x	I do not understand the overhyping of Andrew Luck. Nearly lost at home to TPryor 1st game, did lose home to Tannehill. Averaging 229 a game!

43139414_375322117908086785 x	Dallas is much better than 18th in Power Rankings. I'd say 10th. Jerry can't sleep he's so excited but many are sleeping on this team.
43139414_374963261289930752 x	Cowboys have won 1 playoff game in 17 yrs, gone 6-10, 8-8, 8-8. So why not try saying, "This is THE YEAR"? Romo, new special delivery? GREAT
43139414_373885105095204864 x	Unreal, Johnny Football bolts for 1st down on first play.
43139414_381124001528950785 x	Love watching MVick play but wouldn't want to try winning w/ him at QB. Accuracy comes/goes. Great throws/ bad decisions. Great runs/fumbles

43139414_368448829227417600 x	Vick said something that will hurt Andy Reid: That he has fallen back in love with football. Reid put his job on line for Vick and lost it.
43139414_360849110418464769 x	I will never, ever get over that shot Ray Allen hit. If it misses, LeBron's legacy would have ...

43139414_391997883701948417 x	Chip Kelly won't do it but he should give Matt Barkley a chance in 2nd half. Cowboy fans should hope he doesn't.
43139414_388346157249748992 x	Eli on way to leading NFL in interceptions for 3rd TIME. Made luckiest play in SBowl history to win his 1st, Brady's misfire saved his 2nd.
43139414_368176249375432704 x	Vick looked sharp running Chip Kelly's fastbreak offense. But reverted to bad old Vick, holding ball, heaving interception on final drive.
43139414_377260339252842496 x	Despite this outcome -- I predicted 30-28 Eagles -- no way do I think they will prove better than the Redskins as the season unfolds.
43139414_395981035751493632 x	Wait, Chip Kelly's revolutionary offense managed just 3 points at home against a Dallas D now ranked 32nd and last in the NFL?

43139414_386996631742083073 x	Why am I not surprised? When you least expect it, Romo breaks your heart.
43139414_233653318868692992 x	Most overrated basketball stat: triple double, esp when points under 20. LeBron's 1st ever Olympic triple double: only 11 pts. OVERRATED.

43139414_182909215193571328 x	Sanchez will fold under pressure by midseason. Rex will have HIS kind of QB. Tebow can help Jets become No. 1 rush offense to go w/ top 5 D.
