1710132583_389487049734369281 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973 and what stats have you been looking at! So foles is better because he beat the bucks? #StopItBro
1710132583_389495566977466368 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973 #SimplyPut Vick brings out the maximum potential of Chips Offense, that alone should be enough bro
1710132583_389499161609273344 x	@Eagleman991 not against an 0-5 TEAM! Vick would of Destroyed them today! You can't deny that bro
1710132583_389502088184856576 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973  look at the score when Vick went out? Then at foles 3 and outs against that Defense that let the giants come back
1710132583_389503608955609088 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973 and what does the giants momentum have to do with Foles play? Now who's making excuses lol, Momentum? Really?
1710132583_389504438098198529 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973 two 3 and outs contributed but if we're holding Vick accountable for our sucky D then.........the same goes for foles
1710132583_389506620440731648 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973 when you made an excuse for why the sucky giants came back when foles was put in with the lead... Our d lost the SD game
1710132583_389507488221257728 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973 you said the giants D was worst....but my point is Eli, a good QB! Not a rookie
1710132583_389508402424320000 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973 really so what make the Bucs D better than the giants? Please enlighten me
1710132583_389510012999331840 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973 all I know is the fact that they are both winless against good and mediocre teams..(We're Mediocre) #TruthHurts #DSucks
1710132583_389510567972864000 x	@Eagleman991 @rm973 both because Qb's play Defenses and the fact that Eli was the QB in the last game means that if foles started, we lose
