525940609_390509573330980864 x	@ChipWagoneer I'm liking the breakdowns, but his name is Damaris
525940609_389572904922279938 x	@BGN_Radio this should be good.
525940609_386974785277661184 x	I just realized if Foles would have got hurt today, #Eagles wouldn't have had a QB. Barkley wasn't active
525940609_392013752901464064 x	Please tell me Barkley comes through.
525940609_392014302447554562 x	@Chr_Moran he can throw a pick
525940609_386909070910697472 x	@Chr_Moran Vick with 0 weapons.
525940609_386909710386860032 x	@Chr_Moran Jackson's being double teamed and McCoy can only do so much for the passing game out of the backfield
525940609_386909455851732992 x	I remember the days when Eagles-Giants games were the best, this is unwatchable now.
525940609_330125925305958400 x	Why do the guys on WIP make Domonic Brown sound awful? He doesn't seem terrible to me but I don't watch regular season baseball much.
525940609_239137116309831680 x	Almost game time. Who are you looking forward to watching most? #Eagles
525940609_239148533981278210 x	@Chr_Moran never said I want Foles starting...
525940609_239149792608022528 x	@Chr_Moran Hey no two men are the same. We'll have to see if he can produce into a starter.
525940609_237701889888755715 x	Players I should keep an eye on?
525940609_237701487072002048 x	@Chr_Moran agreed. We don't have to win, just show we're good enough at each position.
525940609_236899694821916672 x	Should #Eagles trade for Tarvaris Jackson?
525940609_387601576522952704 x	?@SheilKapadia: Dick Stockton and Ronde Barber will call Eagles-Bucs this Sunday on FOX.? Some bullshit.

525940609_394137649893478400 x	Can't wait to see Mariota for the first time this year tonight...only for an hour though. Then PSU-OSU.

525940609_381920501431414784 x	49ers are such an inconsistent regular season team...I don't understand why they do good in the playoffs.

525940609_255835755803463680 x	@tolentino_mr @Andrew_Leary21 I'm young but I know about it and I've been there as a child. It's a new era though.
525940609_255837091513106432 x	@tolentino_mr @Andrew_Leary21 nobody thinks that, but Buddy Ryan isn't our coach anymore.
525940609_255838967008739328 x	@tolentino_mr He was the man, but was awful as an offensive coach IMO. However, I wouldn't mind an aggressive coach like Gregg Williams.
525940609_255839538491060224 x	@tolentino_mr you don't like Andy though do you?
525940609_255846307212709890 x	@tolentino_mr I can't stand him on game day either.
525940609_255826069670723584 x	Would you say Calvin Johnson Jr. is experiencing the Madden Curse with his lack of touchdowns?
525940609_255511557465858048 x	Game over, see you tomorrow #EaglesNation
525940609_252730138972803073 x	@tolentino_mr make sure you act like you've been there.
525940609_250990304180711424 x	If you're in a position where you can lose the game by one bad call, then you didn't do enough to win. @ESPN
525940609_249984806836903936 x	I think these announcers were born in Phoenix.

525940609_249936433660452864 x	I narrowed it down. Vick or McCoy jersey?
525940609_247438417372278784 x	#Eagles trending everywhere. The bandwagon has begun. Don't worry, I know where the real fans are! #Philly
525940609_247437122921959424 x	I apologize to everyone I didn't retweet/reply too, so many mentions. Love all my fellow fans.
525940609_247434680817827840 x	WE DID IT! OH MY GOD WE DID IT!
525940609_247432367587880960 x	Oh never mind! but we have to score right now.
525940609_247419597152731136 x	NOT Vick's fault.
525940609_247409416062791680 x	Ed Reed just retire or learn how to tackle.
525940609_247407398560600066 x	I'm glad I'm wrong dude! RT @DCalvelliMusic i think its safe to say your MLB prediction will not be true but for good reason
525940609_247392888135233536 x	We can't even run the ball without a turnover?! Come on. We have this game without mental errors.
525940609_247384177253691392 x	They haven't been calling late hit penalties for Vick since his Falcon's days.
525940609_247383852899770368 x	go for it.
525940609_234838100839374848 x	....Just joking #EaglesNation
525940609_232685416183128064 x	Let's have some honest, unbiased opinions. Do #Eagles have what it takes to be a dynasty? I'll give my opinion tomorrow.
525940609_232695817608245248 x	@tolentino_mr @QB_Eagles1990 aging for the way he plays. I'll actually likes when he gets older, it'll keep him unwilling to take hits.
525940609_232321970061070336 x	Jason Witten says he won't retire until he has a championship. Look for him to demand a trade in the near future. #Eagles
525940609_397529082293805056 x	Iguodala and McNabb were criticized so similarly in Philly.
525940609_397040335253012480 x	Michael Carter-Williams has 2 games with at least 20 points, 10 assists, and 3 steals. Holiday had 3 in 4 years here. Iverson had 45.
525940609_400055390127149056 x	All the #Eagles games the rest of the year are at 1 pm. #Fact
525940609_395241579390447616 x	Damn, forgot how often Iverson played through injury, especially in his MVP year. http://t.co/i7bYQ32VEF
525940609_423842496385671168 x	Remember when Kevin Hart was funny
525940609_423843726415630338 x	@Mir_610Made he sold out
