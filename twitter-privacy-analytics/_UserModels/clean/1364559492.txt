1364559492_356191783253839874 x	At the half of the @MLUltimate championship, @BostonWhitecaps up 11-7 against @SFDogFish. Markette with seven points, early MVP.
1364559492_356190566452690944 x	If @BostonWhitecaps score here, @SFDogfish would HAVE to score before the end of the half #MLUChampionship
1364559492_356189248283623425 x	That score is just what the @SFDogfish needed.
1364559492_356188065166921729 x	With that score, @BostonWhitecaps take a commanding three-point lead with 5 minutes left in the half. @SFDogFish needs to get a break soon.
1364559492_356181418843439104 x	If @SFDogfish continue turning the disc like this, they won't hold on for long against a clean @BostonWhitecaps squad.

1364559492_354373393207930880 x	Mazur put up multiple 10-point performances ? the only player in the @MLUltimate to do so.
1364559492_354634813224910848 x	@DannyFrisbee1 @SemiProUltimate For sure. Love watching Kolick play, and he definitely had a huge impact on your team.
1364559492_354640486323060738 x	@SemiProUltimate @DannyFrisbee1 On my phone I thought you said Kolick. Honestly, there's an stat-based argument that has Cricket > Graham
1364559492_354373293077311491 x	Sure, Kolick and Graham are great, but Graham faded late in the year and Kolick didn't bring as much to the table as Mazur.
1364559492_354385612658311168 x	@SemiProUltimate No, but that's something that I'd be interested in seeing too.
1364559492_354377237690200064 x	Actually, Josh Markette of @BostonWhitecaps had multiple 10-plus point performances as well, but the point still stands.
1364559492_354377102537134081 x	@SemiProUltimate Right! Last time I did the top points list was before Week 9 and 10 stats had come out. My mistake.
1364559492_354372276856172544 x	I think that both Simon and Mazur pass the eye test. If you watch them both play, you KNOW how important they are to their teams.

1364559492_351119127064219648 x	@theTylerByrum If Seattle has all their players, they take that game, for sure. SF was in the Rainmakers' heads a little, also.
