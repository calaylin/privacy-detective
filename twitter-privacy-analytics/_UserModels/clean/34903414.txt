34903414_380174276982489088 x	Is it a violation for @MikeMiss975 to not be following ME on twitter???
34903414_380051266317352960 x	I tweeted the pic of the suit.  Check it out. It's a good luck.
34903414_380055218006011904 x	@WgDrewski why keep the beard?  I grow it and shave it all the time.
34903414_372560954523144193 x	Was playing a bunch of songs acoustic and thinking about recording Bernie from Broomall Unplugged. What acoustics songs should Bernie sing?
34903414_372798879760388096 x	@WgDrewski easy o play and I ear Bernie sing Layne would be great.
34903414_367852507726626816 x	WTF. It took @JoeYounes975 until now to follow me?  #outrage.
34903414_352243745531510784 x	BTW. I was a big fan of bringing tim Thomas here 4 years ago. Not anymore. Never like a 39 year old who took the last year off. Scares me.
34903414_352247055701381120 x	@WgDrewski I heard that and wanted to eat the caller with his phone.
34903414_358063581595582467 x	@KhaliliAmir yeah. It's a joke thing that started with one of his buddies I believe. People have been screwing up my name for years.
34903414_387213934492913664 x	Wow.
34903414_377953732606304256 x	Heading to @NHLFlyers training camp in the morning. Ready for some Hockey. First preseason game Sunday night at 6 on @975TheFanatic #tunein
34903414_377960801220321280 x	@BumpBumpDeBump haha. Yes it is. Bit the payoff, like Damage inc is well worth the wait.
34903414_377964746588561408 x	@BumpBumpDeBump that is a good one.  My personal fav from that album is Battery. "Weak are ripped an torn away"Battery
34903414_382855624364933120 x	@jruepiazza not bad. A little to unorganized musically for me. The actual music seems unfocused and to forced at being heavy.
34903414_381198176319184896 x	Just got home from work and am feasting on leftover grub from Paganos. Insanely good stuff.
34903414_384444089112227840 x	At the quarter poll he is clearly the coach of the year so far.
34903414_380385753559465984 x	Special announcement today at 3;30 on the @mikemiss975 show.
34903414_377223686052646912 x	I really so not think this offense would be as dynamic with Nick Foles.
34903414_387428067800784896 x	@TonysCombover @975TheFanatic @975ShowSheet too soon to tell.
34903414_383020023234981888 x	How can I stop at McDonalds to get a cheeseburger kids meal for my son. And the the burger has no meat. Bun, ketchup, cheese pickle. No meat
