68231935_311542200548864000 x	If we get Revis, we're signing him to a new deal, right? That's gonna be ton of $$$. @JDRapp10 @section244 @mshapiro3 @Bkid24
68231935_311577689788121088 x	Why do they have to sign big names?? Thats what they did the last 2 yrs. You build through draft not free agency.@mshapiro3 @barklev
68231935_311579813754331138 x	@barklev so u want us to just sign FA to fill our needs? S and CB id agree but disagree w/your statement. They will get TE Casey @mshapiro3
68231935_311581133538213889 x	@barklev @mshapiro3 I agree but you dont fill every secondary spot with a free agent. A safety, yes. Maybe a CB but thats it.
68231935_288841710392451072 x	Would love Rob Ryan as DC. @JoshuaAdamLevin @eriksnyder45 @mshapiro3 @barklev @phillybliss @Bkid24 @andhankmarducas @alex_ep
68231935_288843190889504768 x	Obv!. We've been down that road before. @andhankmarducas @JoshuaAdamLevin @eriksnyder45 @mshapiro3 @barklev @phillybliss @Bkid24 @alex_ep
68231935_288466366560862208 x	@mshapiro3 @barklev I'd trade down, this team has too many needs. Unless they know Peters isn't healthy, then need to draft Joeckel
68231935_288415452999348224 x	Marvin Lewis has been CIN coach for 10 yrs and has never won a playoff gm. Lost 3x in last 4 yrs. #Insanity @mshapiro3 @barklev @phillybliss
