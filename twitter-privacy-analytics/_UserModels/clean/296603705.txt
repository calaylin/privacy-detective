296603705_255039259558416384 x	@Kenny_Wallace I would love to see safety workers drive up to Busch next crash stop, look then keep on driving.

296603705_255035787857522690 x	@NASCAR when are you gonna tell the driver if 51 to get out. Would rather have someone on PED's them him. Obvious safety hazard
296603705_252488429718360065 x	@DeLanaHarvick @Hartsy19 is at the race today. Funny guy. Do me a favor and go trip him #hartnelldown #lockoutsucks

296603705_251801661687881728 x	@damnitall48 I got stuck at the boarder. Don't start without me.
296603705_251747402887876608 x	@Kenny_Wallace big difference tho. Dale lost his life in the car. Richard just retired. 3 should never be driven again in cup.
296603705_251493762222653441 x	@hitthatk1d I think it is a couple of states west of you!
296603705_251498320986517505 x	@hitthatk1d probably because I have never seen the show?
296603705_251501084818952193 x	@hitthatk1d when you come home for the holidays me you and Nikki will sit down during the weekend and watch from season 1 #awesomedad

296603705_245574351670370304 x	@JohnBorukCSN who are offering the salaries? Maybe if they didn't offer such high contracts. Try offering dollars instead of mill. On raises
296603705_244988372991496195 x	@MikeVick a win is a win. Put it behind you but learn from mistakes. You are too good to let pull you down!

296603705_243886970550489091 x	@tpanotchCSN no matter which way the fan goes, seems like the players will suffer the most.
296603705_243853322514231297 x	@tpanotchCSN salaries that the owners GM decided to front load because of the salary cap that they wanted in place years ago?
296603705_243852853704269824 x	@tpanotchCSN page 1 let me get this right. Owners made plenty of profit, don't want to share with other teams, want players to cut
296603705_243480664882692096 x	@damnitall48 right back at ya!
296603705_243028797799153664 x	@LHillaryCSN I will watch on CSN but never attend a game again. I will even pass up free tix. Owners created this mess. Stop bidding so hi
