114872969_395547404147359744 x	Excellent question. I'll take win more, but just barely. RT @StephenDeluca: @gonzoCSN win more games or lose more by 20+ points?
114872969_394522875580776448 x	The Eagles got what is known as a "first down." And the crowd cheers.
114872969_388384490139422722 x	Guy walking down the street was eating noodles. You don't see the walk-and-noodle much these days.
114872969_315920261859930112 x	What? RT @mharrisCSN: Zeller is getting his comeuppance in this game...just got his cookies tossed and what not
114872969_380859469733040128 x	When do the Chiefs run the ill-advised end-around? Soon, Andy?
114872969_377255662776250369 x	All the sconce jokes have been made. ALL of them.
114872969_375801421427646465 x	Everyone be nice to @MichelleDBeadle now so Twitter will stop breaking and we can watch the game.

114872969_349328208421847040 x	Sixers deny report, official response from team is that Adam Aron has not been fired. #Sixerstalk
114872969_341284168862420992 x	Now I'm considering uping the "DELCO!" ante. Pehaps a "DELCO!" tat in old English lettering across my stomach.
114872969_391254507331792896 x	Well argued, counselor RT @hater_ex: @gonzoCSN good at stats. Stats don't win championships. Romos a loser!
114872969_391243409404751872 x	Hate him. Mock him. Doesn't matter. Tony Romo is really good http://t.co/fN9jZBmEEo #Eaglestalk
114872969_380871689678360576 x	Wow. Chiefs have Akeem Jordan, too? KC is like a retirement home for awful Eagles.
114872969_391989095167426560 x	@GeoffMosherCSN @RoobCSN So which one of us gets to write the super-fun punter story?

114872969_353977761053945856 x	Jonathan Papelbon is the anti-Cliff Lee in terms of the time it takes to throw a baseball.
114872969_120670219395006464 x	So about that hunch you had on Carpenter, Tony LaRussa...
114872969_389848125768474624 x	The Eagles have two QBs that have performed well. So why is everyone acting like that's a problem? http://t.co/0RbNnMnW99 #Eaglestalk
114872969_379309824225607680 x	This game is slop for everyone but Philip Rivers and LeSean McCoy. #Eaglestalk
114872969_379302410315120640 x	That was Rivers' first incomplete pass of the game. He started 10-for-10 for 103 yards and a TD. #Eaglestalk

114872969_350437451816378368 x	Not crazy about moving a 23-year-old All-Star, but the return, on paper, is solid. #Sixerstalk
114872969_267715677299802112 x	Uh oh. Turkey in the press box for lunch. Eagles-Cowboys on the field. This has halftime coma written all over it.
114872969_380365651187343362 x	Here's the problem. @ColWolfeFox29 wants to go look at this dog. But looking @ a dog means getting a dog. So the decision must be made first
114872969_375804614270279680 x	Oh no. He doesn't get it.
114872969_322135845920448512 x	This phone will not stop ringing. Who even has the number to a press row land line at the Sixers?
