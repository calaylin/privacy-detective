41238317_360197730469027841 x	I am fascinated by sports science. It's extremely interesting to me. What Chip Kelly & the #Eagles are doing is going to change the @NFL.
41238317_242044919588474880 x	Getting ready to watch the No. 1 QB in the country & the top pick in the 2013 #NFLDraft, #USC QB @MattBarkley.
