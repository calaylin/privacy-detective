47048859_40430289373245440 x	@davefry04 thats what I think too, but man, it's hard to turn down that many points
47048859_40441410251395072 x	@davefry04 I hate Cameron Indoor, they get every call and refs become intimidated by Coach K
47048859_394151684366409729 x	@36westbrook Eagles 9 losses in a row at home. Giants 8 losses in a row on the road. 23-23 tie.
47048859_393375141801254912 x	Man I'd love to see Favre return. You would too, so don't even try to tell me otherwise. If he returned, that game would be flexed...

47048859_391988053134557185 x	Wife's 85 year old grandfather just came over. Looks at score and says: "I thought Skip Kelly was some offensive whiz kid?". True story
47048859_391973587936366592 x	No Ware & twice under duress? Not good.. #Eaglestalk
47048859_390628134896558080 x	@MikeMiss975 tbs shouldn't have baseball or march madness.
47048859_390556614262259712 x	Here's another for ya... Who was the best "missing piece" that a team/player acquired to finally get over the top?
47048859_390555216279769088 x	That being said, fill in the blank. The greatest player ever who had nothing around him or needed help was/is  _____ ?
47048859_388023053936259072 x	Ok #FantasyFootball heads, I need YOUR help... RB 2 this week: MJD at Den, Law Firm at Buf or Hillman vs Jax?

47048859_388718514296864768 x	Oh & rumor has it I made "whiner of the week", hear my whine at 3:30 on @MikeMiss975 show.
47048859_387718740751974400 x	Prediction: #Flyers to go 79-0 in Berubes 1st year. Lock it in
47048859_353288545940676609 x	Very solid move by #Flyers getting Emery on a 1-year, low money deal. Definitely like it. @HARRYMAYES975 and I both thought he was ideal...
47048859_395704942050443264 x	Andrew Bynum with 3 pts & 3 boards... Just give him comeback player of the year now! #Loser
47048859_393375220230537216 x	And you'd watch it. It's ok to admit it.
47048859_327592400694427650 x	6 of the last 7 offensive tackles selected 4th overall in the past 30 years have made a pro bowl. #Eagles #NotLAME

47048859_164181269159223297 x	What's less believable? Daniel Bryan as World Champ? Or Juan Castillo as an NFL defensive coordinator?
47048859_163715048760553472 x	Warm weather here, plus the Farmers Ins Open has me ready for golf season to start. Faldo and Feherty are ready...is @HARRYMAYES975 ?

47048859_379341477341822976 x	A win 4 days from now and your 2-1 and life is good with a W over Andy. Good thing this is a real short week for team & fans
47048859_360908067950444546 x	Seriously, how catchy is the WaWa "Hoagie Fest" theme? Absolutely love it!
47048859_315809598051336192 x	FIFA 13 named best sports video game of all-time?! Really? Not even close!!! What's your favorite? @975TheFanatic @JayA_975

47048859_167424377795788800 x	Lin has had a few solid games, but come on...he wasn't even that good as Ricky Tan in Rush Hour!
47048859_138465985861648387 x	Nnamdi stinks. I wonder what Troy Vincent is doing?
47048859_138445486641262592 x	Way to go Desean. Good job buddy. #Traded
47048859_119402373662781440 x	Plus, which "media throwdown" would you love to see happen? Nationally and locally? #LetsGetItOn
47048859_116589640328298496 x	Tatupu must be really #Cooked if the #Eagles wouldn't give him a crack following their LB shuffle
47048859_394540556560629761 x	Chip Kelly could've been 9 weeks away from a BCS title game vs Bama, instead he inherited the left over stench of the Andy Reid regime...
47048859_386921578971557888 x	Did Foles steal Vicks visor?
47048859_385535826161311745 x	I know Lavi said he would like to split time with Emery & Mason, or slightly more Emery than Mason, but I hope 1 emerges
47048859_385220856349466624 x	You guys up for a "Twit-Chat"? I'm down! Send questions now, I'll answer all of them. Philly sports, national, college, personal, etc...
47048859_385223732698288128 x	@FFootballTools draft...without question. How did Nnamdi, DRC, Barwin & Sopoaga turn out?
47048859_381922618494160896 x	After a dynamic 1st week in #FantasyFootball my team has shit the bed the last 2 weeks. I am disgusted
47048859_380866043692216320 x	Alex Smith hands off to Bryce Brown? Nessler needs to quit hanging with Corso! #COOKED
47048859_380854362782040064 x	This is EXACTLY the start I warned everyone about last night on the show. Sloppy, too amped up, turnover prone football.
47048859_396437474794569728 x	Capitals now up 6-0, atleast the #Flyers blocked the PAT
47048859_376800342178295808 x	Bills fans... Find a new team.
47048859_396445896449466368 x	Terrible 2 possessions by Sixers, need to work clock a bit. Way too early to shoot in shot clock

47048859_386950895071928320 x	The million dollar question: how was Foles able to put up the numbers he did with the same WRs who can't get open?...
47048859_384859702343237632 x	Darren Sproles is having himself a night!

47048859_391933663367430145 x	Brian Jones of CBS just called Johnny Manziel the "loose deuce". @TonyBrunoShow has been called that before, but only after Taco Tuesdays
47048859_384060232571572224 x	I should have my head examined for backing ND with 4 pts. Tommy Reiss? Irish would be better off with Tommy Byrne at the helm @TomByrneShow

47048859_395380354384941056 x	@Winless4Mariota haha...like Mariotta, but question is do Eagles like him enough to mortgage away draft to get?
