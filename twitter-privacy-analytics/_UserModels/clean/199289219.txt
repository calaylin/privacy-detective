199289219_387546527096651776 x	This morning proves that I'm a good guy and deserve a woman who appreciates me.
199289219_387303506874744832 x	Not having a stellar day @pandora_radio
199289219_387284722373914624 x	Chemistry so intense that you crave her like you have never craved anyone or anything else.

199289219_386930647287484416 x	And my second drink of the day has been made.
199289219_386928909406986240 x	OMG!!!Celek held on to a pass
199289219_386925192750305280 x	Got the evil eye when I had a drink with lunch. Hey, you aren't giving it up, I gotta find some way to relax.
199289219_386896217491656704 x	If I look you in the eye, ask you what's wrong and you always say nothing, then fuck you. I can't fix a problem if I don't know what it is.

199289219_386702805227933696 x	To make myself a drink or not to make myself a drink...what kinda stupid fucking question is that?
199289219_386696211106775040 x	@Hot_Mandi_Jason Sure thing babe
199289219_386694199568908289 x	@LipLush1 Just stop wearing clothes
199289219_386693701285576704 x	@ajax06 You shouldn't hate.  Ugly people need love too.
199289219_386693012631220224 x	@LipLush1 Here and there ;)
199289219_386693262729179136 x	@LipLush1 What you been up to?
199289219_386692739405840384 x	That feeling where you want to say just fucking go to sleep so I can masturbate in peace...yeah that.
199289219_386689094157209600 x	So I am going to blame the fact that I am unable to deal with her shitty attitude tonight on the awesome time I had last night.
199289219_386687355655966720 x	RT @LipLush1: It opened up nicely  *wine snobs at the bar  or my date, last night, about my mouth
199289219_386687202366726145 x	RT @DontTouchMyWine: My dress measures 16" top to bottom. My heels measure 5.5 inches. If you're into numerology this means you are totally?

199289219_386551950676090880 x	And it isn't so much the actual shopping as it is the paying for it part.
199289219_386551118337425408 x	Am I the only one here who loves food, but hates grocery shopping?
199289219_385809938637148160 x	I am just 5 short hours away from the 48 hour mark damned impressive.
199289219_385792855534735360 x	@lexuhbooz Don't worry, they don't know who their goalie is either.
199289219_385787646431485952 x	Does anyone else think the people who designed all the <INSERT NAME HERE> Saga games on Facebook was suffering from delusions of grandeur?
199289219_385505935776841728 x	@SassyMcMelons I'm still following, but I'd still love to eat your mound if that's ok.
199289219_384424400206180352 x	Still having problems in the red zone. Andy obviously wasn't the entire problem. #Eagles #Broncos
199289219_384420108971835392 x	That's embarrassing! He was in the back of the fucking end zone!!! #Eagles #Broncos
199289219_384419179694391296 x	Can't settle for 3!!! #Eagles #Broncos
199289219_384416737384755200 x	Damn this defense is soft in the secondary. #Eagles # Broncos
199289219_384414453175160832 x	Can't have too many 3 and outs with as bad as the defense is. #Eagles #Broncos
199289219_384391495530594304 x	@AnasHotBox I prefer Cool Whip
199289219_384118312164409344 x	I dont remember the last time my legs were this sore. Oh wait, yes I do. Last year when I did @spartanrace. #coincidence #ithinknot
199289219_384385582077861888 x	@SpartanRace You bet. I might do the one in Palmyra, at Blue Mountain, next year. I did that one last year.

199289219_384317754352087040 x	@KrissiBex Have fun watching them beat up my #Eagles. I'm thinking 38-27 #Broncos.
199289219_384317203212152832 x	When are the #Eagles going to have an exciting young QB that the fans can be excited to watch? Jealous of the Seahawks and 49ers.
199289219_384314334983520256 x	Still feeling so tired. Didn't sleep well last night. Wishing some of you were here to help relieve the wood I woke up with at 2 am.
199289219_384127972086927360 x	"@LipLush1: Telling her she's special means nothing..  ..treating her special means everything" Truth!
199289219_384127602111553536 x	@LipLush1 Always wanted to go to a gentleman's club with a lady.
199289219_383698753817182208 x	@BlakWidowBarbee Have one for me. No booze for me tonight, got a race tomorrow.
199289219_384116276618358784 x	@BlakWidowBarbee Don't I wish.
199289219_384118647733886976 x	@BlakWidowBarbee I think we need to test that theory out, both ways. I can think of some places I'd like to rub and see what happens.
199289219_384115455361044480 x	@SpartanRace I participated in the Spartan Sprint at Citizens Bank Park today. My favorite even was the traverse wall.
199289219_383693011361992704 x	@Not_JustAnyGirl Can you explain that to my gf?
199289219_383675713544802304 x	You know that line that people shouldn't push you over, well she pushed me over it last night.
199289219_383675271867805696 x	Timeline is starting to get clogged up with crap again. Quality over quantity.
199289219_382952320772096000 x	Can it just be five already so I can go to the gym?
199289219_382931208046657536 x	@Jenezebel6 I'd love to try to make you
199289219_382922933842501632 x	"@Milf_Jennifer: RT @SandyC4fun Too much #Cleavage? http://t.co/c1k4YMMiPC" I think that is the perfect amount.
