591067403_331888037057413120 x	@jtyszka16 do you play for the drake?
591067403_331888709194629120 x	@jtyszka16 small world.  Your guys just played my squad last night.
591067403_331890554365415424 x	@jtyszka16 seemed like a good group of dudes though. There are a couple assholes in the league but it's a good league in general.
591067403_392082277829591040 x	Geno isn't a superstar yet, but he shows flashes, makes plays, & looks like he's just scratching the surface. He's not RGIII, but he's good.
591067403_361298969831280641 x	I feel like Wilson Valdez would have pitched better tonight than Raul Valdez.  Yikes.
591067403_361289575366262784 x	@Faux975Caller on this team, I don't know how lucky anyone is to be part of it.
591067403_355827339617243137 x	@Faux975Caller thanks pal. I knew there were a lot of good entries, but I felt I put a good one out there as well. I'll keep trying.
