1950211951_392029306496364544 x	@kieranjwelsh I feel like we should go defense first. This years QB class is good I feel we can get one in the 2nd and 3rd
1950211951_392029986837635072 x	@kieranjwelsh Mariota is gonna go to the bucs that's a fact. I want Hundley from UCLA if we go QB
1950211951_392023123908132864 x	Forget a QB 1st round I want Ha-Ha Clinton-Dix great saftey him and Earl Wolff can be deadly
1950211951_392022783271911425 x	I'm not even mad at Barkley he got thrown into the game
1950211951_392020069980848128 x	Ok defense did stop them there I'm not saying we're gonna win but let's just see what happens
1950211951_392021690106253312 x	@Chozet83 thank you
1950211951_392016317366419456 x	There still over 9 minutes everyone thought it was over against the giants 3 years ago. Just believe

1950211951_392014037116280833 x	Hold them defense
1950211951_392013267528581120 x	I will take the field goal...should've been a TD. But defense has been good so far
1950211951_392008849903083520 x	I don't want to hear anything how we should've started Vick. Monte Kiffin is a defensive genius. He Would be doing the same for Vick
1950211951_392011762788495361 x	@A_dizzle24 do you remember those Bucs defenses from 2000-2008? yeah genius
