94190621_262798033283076096 x	Word is Reid to make QB change and go with Foles. This move will effectively end Reid's tenure as Eagles Head Coach @ yrs end!
94190621_263046829950787584 x	@DtxDt R u expecting for Nick Foles 2 b a future Elway or Manning??????????
94190621_263054643830079488 x	@DtxDt Love McCoy but he can protect better too!!
94190621_263071344302907393 x	@DtxDt I have said all along this team has no leaders. Who on either side of the ball has played consistent enough to have a voice???????
94190621_263086218714157056 x	@DtxDt I watched DRC in AZ, in the beginning he was an emerging young player, as he got better he took too many chances, he's declining too
94190621_263088544925507584 x	@DtxDt I got 1 good series and I'm done!
94190621_398611145080074240 x	@Avicker88 I agree that everyone deserves to be treated humanely, but when do u stand up for self? That lockeroom is a place like no other
94190621_398614596530888704 x	@Avicker88 The lockeroom usually polices itself, w/ the vets being the deputies. I just think it should've been resolved internally
94190621_398615988528111616 x	@treblaw Hey I'm conversing with you guys, but don't get it twisted, he's a pansy. A man won't let another man punk him like that. Sorry MHO
94190621_398643322031325184 x	@hipsterboner Sorry u feel that way Im a realist. Football is a man's game. Take Heart to play it and it ain't for everyone!
94190621_398906698359767040 x	@hipsterboner because he chose this institution & mild hazing & manliness comes w/ the job. Lastly he made it public. No on else ever has!
94190621_398910231876358144 x	@hipsterboner I endured no big deal, rite of passage. Some traditions & cultures r inherited, what other player been documented complaining?
94190621_398913467505057792 x	@SpikeEskin You have the option to pledge or not! Everything in life comes down to your choice! Shall we do away w/ frats too??
94190621_398917255049646080 x	@SpikeEskin Don't go there, basic Human rights vs your choice to pledge a frat. Come w a better analogy than that man!
94190621_398934447380119552 x	@SpikeEskin No that's why we hv a constitution that spells out those rights for everyone, not just the self proclaimed privilidged few!
94190621_398958191486050305 x	@clothingscott1 Ur point is?? You have to observe the thread to know why the conversation wound up there!
94190621_398966294604574720 x	@clothingscott1 We r in agreement. I wanted u to read the thread. Spike said Human Rights are up 4 interpretation, not according to Const!
