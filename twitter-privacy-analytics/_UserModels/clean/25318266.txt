25318266_255824042311966720 x	@iannetta The bad news: it's definitely a 4-6 wk injury. Good news: He doesn't need surgery.
25318266_196022275680641024 x	Disagree w/ NHL Network analysis of Flyers-Devils. I thought PHI did fine job of "getting out of run-and-gun mindset" in Gm 5-6 vs. Pitt.

25318266_394476235390074881 x	@jsaquella Good question.
25318266_394480272223125504 x	@TheOrangeUpdate @jsaquella No, but he had awful turnover that the Flyers were lucky didn't end up in their own net.
25318266_392662655657205760 x	Combos: 40-28-12 , 15-10-93, 24-14-17, 18-25-36. Extras: 19-45-37.
25318266_312009808557527041 x	Also, the Flyers haven't scored a single third period goal in the month of March to date.
25318266_396707877861076994 x	Lecavalier injury is only day-to-day after all.
25318266_396470853224767488 x	@ctherien6 Exactly, Bundy. There was lack of compete going on in that 2nd pd, he was steamed about mask being knocked off, and had enough.
25318266_394981517308329984 x	Miller denied Whitney on 2-on-1 with Chiasson. He is only reason Sabres still in this game.
25318266_394821538244870144 x	At end of last night's games around NHL, Flyers have given up fewest goals (27) of any Metro Div team. On league-wide basis, they rank 7th.
25318266_394822950387335168 x	@bbrbrts Yes, I do. Maybe not top 7 but top 10, so long as they understand and buy into what Berube wants from them.
