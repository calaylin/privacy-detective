569301365_390674016102793216 x	@Sportswriter22 they would need several injuries to multiple players. They have a solid team, will fight for playoffs. Sixers are pathetic!
569301365_390676131730718720 x	@Sportswriter22 ok. Sixers have Thad, ET, rookie MCW, and rookie nerlens for half the year. Everyone else is a joke
569301365_390678132279508992 x	@Sportswriter22 @Winless4Wiggins we were talking about this yr and 2014 draft. Sixers will have 10 wins. Wizards 40+. Sixers better next yr
