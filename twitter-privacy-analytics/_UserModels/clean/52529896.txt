52529896_346436901143707648 x	Both teams scoring at Globetrotter pace.   Absurd for NBA Finals.
52529896_344632441102811136 x	I'm all in on Norris Cole.   That's all.
52529896_343064427920228352 x	@jkotsko86 not according to American tv viewers.
52529896_342820490253062144 x	Spurs have NOBODY with body to match up w Leb
52529896_342824687350456320 x	@TrevorOwens81 Indy could at least get physical with him
52529896_342813098480132096 x	The quality of Miami's shots--- excellent.   Wasn't until game 3 at Indy they got this many solid looks.
52529896_342821661273358336 x	Miami's body language is 100x more comfortable than vs Indy.  Doesn't mean they win series. But they look more comfortable.

52529896_392111588934959104 x	Who knew? This game apparently features TWO quarterbacks.
52529896_391574553555918848 x	Cardinals fan has become Spurs fan.  They are convinced the media pulls against them. #lowsportsselfesteem
52529896_391580867241713664 x	@SteveSpoiler yes.  And more yes.
52529896_391586106665607168 x	Midwest fans--many of you w coastal angst seem to gloss over coverage Packers, Bears, Colts, Steelers, ND, OSU, Bulls, Jayhawk BB receive
52529896_387348496007069696 x	Told USC's Pat Haden will go after biggest fish for HC gig.  Will work way down the list.  Making splash will matter. Dark horse is doubtful
52529896_383583638425985024 x	Baylor and their brilliant coach Art Briles leads coll fb in points AND yards.  Anyone consider RGIII benefitted greatly from that system.

52529896_381569969856970752 x	Stanford and Baylor look like very well coached teams to me.  Win or lose.
52529896_362988916166897664 x	Cure for cigar hangover anyone?
52529896_314885164507484160 x	I was so close taking Oregon but I lacked courage.   People who lack courage stink.  Therefore,  I stink.

52529896_374292085480112128 x	Bridgewater>Clowney if I'm an NfL GM.  Not close.  Said it a week ago.  Gap widening.
52529896_364167948014858240 x	Drip, drip, drip.  What did I guarantee  would happen ? Never fails.
52529896_398665190444908544 x	Feels like Oregon is losing more than a game tonight.  The entire program feels smaller.  Flashy, fun, exciting yet inevitably limited.
52529896_289427437203357696 x	Not saying Kelly is leaving ND--simply saying--this Eagles story is not JUST leverage play.  His interest is legit.
