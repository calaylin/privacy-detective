1460086987_392367971907026944 x	@replytoallen He has some pieces, but not all he'd like. It's not a total rebuild, but '14 draft is huge for him moving forward #c32chat
1460086987_392369672093302784 x	@replytoallen yes and no. That's hard to predict right now. I think you have to evaluate that later, but he needs to find staters this year
1460086987_392368006942052352 x	RT @replytoallen: @cover32_PHI Fair to accept that the Eagles are a 2-3 year project, similar to when a college needs to recruit "system" p?
1460086987_392367766537109504 x	@replytoallen Kind of. There's certainly an expectation where Chip needs to adapt with what he has, but also pieces he needs to get #c32chat

1460086987_392358522630848512 x	@Flyeaglesfly51 but do you hold any weight on the fact that Barkley threw for more yards in 1Q yesterday than Foles? #c32chat
1460086987_392360631338143745 x	@Flyeaglesfly51 so you're saying you think Kelly absolutely needs a guy that can move? Then who would you look at in the draft? #c32chat
1460086987_392361394076516352 x	@Flyeaglesfly51 I think you can go WR in rounds 2-3 and still come away with a #2 guy. If Mariota's there, grab him #c32chat
1460086987_392362525297094656 x	@Flyeaglesfly51 but I think you can go that way in round 2-3. Jordan Matthews, Moncrief, Allen Robinson. All 6-3ish guys who grab passes
1460086987_392359592262242304 x	@Leaping_Leo do you think Barkley can be a long term option? #c32chat
1460086987_392359006213140480 x	@mew90 Aside from the 3 picks yesterday, Barkley looked good. Got ball out quick, hit guys in stride. But still learning #c32chat
1460086987_392358331710337024 x	@NJNuke valid point. He certainly could have done a lot for himself with a strong game yesterday but saying he's done isn't 100% fair
1460086987_392358151732731904 x	RT @NJNuke: #c32chat Seems just as silly to say Foles can't be the future based on yesterday as it would have been to say he IS the future ?
1460086987_392356623965888512 x	@eastcoastdog who do you suggest? Certainly a whole lot of opens, late and mid-round #c32chat
