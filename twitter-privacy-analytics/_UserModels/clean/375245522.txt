375245522_395227479020802048 x	Really wondering if rumors were true that Hank got Torts fired. If so, wondering even more if he still thinks grass is greener on other side
375245522_395230782911832064 x	@TKBlueshirt Story about what? Rumors? They were rumblings after Torts fired. Personally didnt believe them. More curious how Hank feels now
375245522_395232998292852736 x	@TKBlueshirt Nope...was more for the second part. Hank not starting tonight isn't normal & I'm curious what he's thinking of all changes.
375245522_395243220038197248 x	@TKBlueshirt Are you sure? A lot of teams split goalies on back to backs and maybe AV is one of them.
