201097133_397928630925656064 x	@David_Boreanaz @NHLFlyers Mason played his ass off and all they could do was get 1 goal for him. Unreal. Anybody is tradable at this point

201097133_86000702471684096 x	@spodein What's up Podes. Can I get a shoutout to the OLD Main Street Pub in Voorhees. You were one of my favorite players for the Flyers.

201097133_77127953938513920 x	@Nick975Fanatic Scratch that Lohse comment.
201097133_77121306042175488 x	@Nick975Fanatic How nice would it be to have Kyle Lohse as our 5th starter.
201097133_77003751101186049 x	@HARRYMAYES975 ooooohhhh. Good gor you.
201097133_75383020231737344 x	@HARRYMAYES975 can you tell me how Bartolo Collon is hitting 95 in the 9th inning?  Oh I know HGH
201097133_74053577454264320 x	@_Scuba_ Missanelli was right I guess. Tony is more worried about the national media than Philly. He's a sellout.
