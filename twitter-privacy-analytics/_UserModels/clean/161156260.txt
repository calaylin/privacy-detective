161156260_394490165982666752 x	@Al_DeLaurentis @jsaquella these guys need more than 6 min toi which is typical of the 4th line. Even at nhl level that's not good enough
161156260_394493986901360640 x	@Al_DeLaurentis @jsaquella rinaldo is a 4th liner. Mcginn or cousins need more than 4th line minutes. He had barely over 3 min toi yesterday
161156260_394260307729596416 x	Rinaldo just took Coburns shot off his face
