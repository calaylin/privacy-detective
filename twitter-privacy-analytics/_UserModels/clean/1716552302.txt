1716552302_393753581293027328 x	I'm guessing the #Sixers waived Vander Blue because his 3-point accuracy (43%) didn't fit with the tanking plan. #Blue#Wiggins

1716552302_393038807529844736 x	Just watched the #Eagles game again. #Foles wasn't as awful as I thought. He wasn't good, but I didn't vomit either. Well, a little.

1716552302_391030154677723137 x	I feel like the #Flyers are already eliminated from playoff contention.

1716552302_384119931375083520 x	@975TheFanatic Sure they can. They just need early injuries to Peyton and Welker.....and Vick to not throw it directly to Bronco defenders.
