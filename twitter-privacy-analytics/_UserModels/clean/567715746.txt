567715746_397577922011095041 x	@WxTrackerDaryl Why are insurance companies making these decisions?
567715746_397581005415915520 x	.@WxTrackerDaryl Kaiser is/was a good insurance company. Had em for years. ACA is breaking otherwise good companies & I believe on purpose
567715746_397583799233425408 x	@WxTrackerDaryl Agreed. I see ppl waking up, tho. Folks I never thought would. I have hope that if we lose this fight we'll win the war
567715746_397583969484410881 x	@WxTrackerDaryl That last tweet was terrible bc 140 chars stinks but I hope you understood the context lol
567715746_397579250842083328 x	.@WxTrackerDaryl Right. They can't afford it bc of the Affordable Care Act regs. Aetna is a small insurance co compared w/ BCBS, Kaiser, etc
567715746_397580137765412865 x	@WxTrackerDaryl It's insane & I'm sorry ur getting hit hard here. I'm noticing a LOT of the letters submitted 2 http://t.co/JLlfQTJijs r CA
