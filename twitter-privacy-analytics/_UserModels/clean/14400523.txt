14400523_83677968676827137 x	Pulled out of driveway at 3:10am. Should pull in around 7:35pm. Quite the workday, but worth it to hang with that amazing family.
14400523_83897295938125824 x	@RandySmilo90 thank you so much for watching!!
14400523_370291535755366400 x	So far we've gotten to 88 today, but still no 90 this August! The last time we had an August without 90's was in 1984.#wayback
14400523_368141234462007296 x	You made my week! :) thx RT @kcw131: A vocally-weakened and technologically-failing Kate Bilo is still the top weather report in town.
14400523_367410861666598913 x	Nothing like realizing your clicker batteries are dead at the top of weather hit. Luckily producer/guru Steve is always on the ball.
14400523_367338957719482368 x	Luckily it was black. However I smelled like Eau de Wet Philly Parking Lot all morning. They should bottle that lovely aroma.
14400523_395592027838377984 x	Do you remember any particularly nasty Halloween weather growing up? Ever trick-or-treat in snow, pouring rain, extreme cold?
14400523_395282060497387522 x	@mitymoe129 they are great! Thanks!
14400523_395242035713945601 x	@mitymoe129 sure, send a couple over!
14400523_395238865319256064 x	Far cry from a year ago... just lovely! RT @mitymoe129: From this morning @katebilo http://t.co/WEO5VwKgE1
14400523_395236016468279296 x	WOW... that's stunning. RT @SteveCigars: @katebilo @KathyOrrCBS3 http://t.co/VXPQisS8wd

14400523_395210258542788608 x	I could keep going.
14400523_394950962122874880 x	Beautiful sunset tonight. #Philly #nofilter http://t.co/XgRu3K2L1B
14400523_395208202876628992 x	"Should touching a pregnant woman's belly be illegal?" Without consent? Absolutely! Don't mess with a pregnant lady! http://t.co/aEtMjMkB19
14400523_387958905286193152 x	@julieannecross haha! You are not alone. I feel like I SHOULD like it and I've tried, but just... No.
14400523_217758142816198657 x	Just landed in Los Angeles!! Let's hope my suitcase did too! Sooo thrilled to be here.
14400523_278247926680125441 x	Finally some SUNSHINE in the 7-day forecast!!! But don't get used to temperatures in the 60's...
14400523_278261069535928321 x	@JPCSR30 I guess so! it was STUNNING every day! :)
14400523_238389097536815106 x	We may have to keep an eye on Saturday for an increased risk of showers thanks to low pressure off the Carolinas. Will keep you posted.
14400523_393105097859039233 x	I'll be in the studio with your forecast today at 5 & 6 pm! You'll LOVE the forecast... if you like the cold!
14400523_397153821354643457 x	How is it only seven o'clock?!
14400523_395979021684850688 x	What is your LEAST favorite Halloween Candy? The one that makes you go "ughhh, another one of THESE?"
14400523_393708956117651458 x	Is there anything cuter than a bundled baby? Good thing he has a light saber. Never know when a Sith will show up. http://t.co/iR7bTep55M
