40373720_391781842887921664 x	They keep saying Boston went from worst to first, they struggled but they were not close to the worst last year
40373720_391781321456226304 x	Next stop for Koji, hotdog eating contest
40373720_391780576908562433 x	It's weird the Red Sox got a trophy for 2003 AL Champs, they lost to New York
40373720_391776398727462912 x	Should be a good World Series, I'm pulling for @ShaneVictorino
40373720_391769962467315713 x	I just want them to show Shane's grandslam off CC, that's a reasonable request
40373720_391768539805515776 x	Favorite homeruns 1. @mstairs12 off Broxton 2. @ShaneVictorino grandslam off CC 3. Joe Blanton's World Series homerun
40373720_391767908915089408 x	Atta boy @ShaneVictorino Not his first playoff grandslam
40373720_391767170335920128 x	@RoobCSN tweets like this, on top of all your great Eagles coverage, makes you one of the best people to follow on Twitter
40373720_391764215192887296 x	Hard to hit a ball much better than Gomes did and not hit a homerun
40373720_391761170967060480 x	Rodger Workman is struggling to field this inning, couple costly plays could make a big difference
40373720_391758694503165952 x	@Taraa_Shumack yea, I was surprised to get call that early. I'm sorry to hear that you're dead, enjoy the afterlife
40373720_391757617644974080 x	@Taraa_Shumack tonight was a Markee night. Let's just say it was a good thing I brought a trash bag with me
40373720_391757186680254464 x	It wouldn't be a complete weekend at West Chester if I didn't have to pick up a drunk
40373720_391748704170160128 x	@samherman40 Tigers gonna make a comeback?
40373720_391593144317657088 x	@ESPN_Colin @SteveSpoiler and it's BS, they've been in 4 of the last 10 WS. Like it's hard to support a good team, not impressed
40373720_391590688367714304 x	@ESPN_Colin For the record, Pittsburgh is in PA, last time I checked east coast state
40373720_391441448710967296 x	Watching Role Models kinda makes me want to LARP
40373720_391427107248930816 x	@BBBaumgartner how much will Magic spend now? Cano? McCann?
40373720_391412816865148928 x	Watching Wacka dick it like this is impressive, but somewhat depressing. We're both 22, I've done nothing with my life #TULO
40373720_391409317041430528 x	I don't know how the Cardinals do it year in and year out. Model franchise of MLB, they do it the right way
40373720_391406982647013376 x	Don't like that the Cardinals are going to another World Series, but fuck the Dodgers
40373720_391394382009880576 x	KFC needs to change their commercials for the To Go Cups. Change the Cops stealing from each other to 2 girls sharing it #TwoGirlsOneToGoCup
40373720_391392103626211328 x	Cardinals saved all their runs for Game 6 apparently
40373720_391390188301471744 x	And that's why they're gonna spend $300 million on Cano
40373720_391364037109612544 x	Two good teams, that dislike each other always makes for interesting TV

40373720_391342871921840128 x	@ByDavidMurphy you think Kubiak is coaching Texas next year?
40373720_391349054330109953 x	@ByDavidMurphy Fair point, I don't think he's tied to the hip with Schaub, he could get another shot with a new QB
40373720_391352686836457472 x	@ByDavidMurphy the way they're looking now they could end up with a fairly high pick. If they think they're a QB away they could trade up
