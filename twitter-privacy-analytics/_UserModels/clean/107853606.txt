107853606_388675389586800641 x	@connorchewpac Absolutley but it's because of the money. The better they produce, the better contract they  well get.
107853606_388676870403022848 x	@connorchewpac Respectively disagree with you, sir. He cheated the game. Cheaters should never prosper.

107853606_388666473335361537 x	If you are a writer and put your vote on the HOF ballot for Barry Bonds you're disgracing the game. @officialBBWAA http://t.co/XSVZ3qEDHv
107853606_388667941887041536 x	@connorchewpac That's the unfortunate part. I wouldn't say half are, but if they elect him in I'll boycott the game for life.
107853606_388672426071953408 x	@connorchewpac Bonds is far from the best hitter of all time. I wouldn't put him in top 20. Mays, Aaron, Ruth, Gehrig, Mantle, Griffey Jr.
107853606_388673703170420736 x	@connorchewpac No way. When you cheat the game you deserve nothing. Especially the honor of being in HOF. It's like making Osama the POTUS
107853606_388674245905362944 x	@connorchewpac Name five HOFers who have been proven to have cheated.
107853606_388673287510700033 x	@connorchewpac No way. Best power hitters were Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Aaron, Griffey Jr. Bonds cheated. He used steroids FOR POWER IMPROVEMENT
