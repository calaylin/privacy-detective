45821393_391915295075733504 x	@Sports_TweetN that is exactly what I am saying.
45821393_391916382151270400 x	@Sports_TweetN thats really good. Im sure they'll pull those stats out at the end of the season when they miss the playoffs again.
45821393_391917794771865600 x	@Sports_TweetN im not talking about next season, though. They are terrible now.
45821393_391930158934130689 x	@Sports_TweetN awfully! We've been rubbish!
45821393_391931148534050817 x	@Sports_TweetN we spent big on an aging running back when we needed a stronger secondary. Our defence is appalling.
45821393_391932108786372609 x	@Sports_TweetN would be nice to have julio and white fit, though. But, against this mob, we shouldn't have too many problems.
