49165331_140962981193334784 x	@KindysFactory Not going to Kindy's to buy something I can get at any local store without the long long lines and at a cheaper price!
49165331_140525736321757184 x	@KindysFactory Worst wait lines ever. This is the last year for me. Over-rated too!
49165331_140523857739124737 x	@KindysFactory worst*
49165331_140521801255108608 x	@KindysFactory Kindy's has the worse checkout system...they really need to spend more time redesigning the flow...this is ridiculous!

49165331_135563959506964480 x	@danawhite It wasn't Great Dana, but it was hype (literally!). Even the NFL has blow-outs, so wishing you, UFC, and Fox much success.

49165331_135158263875514368 x	Can't wait for UFC on Fox tomorrow. I also can't wait to see my little girl sing live  in a show being held at the Art Museum tomorrow. DVR!
49165331_135157505671172097 x	@danawhite Using Comcast, so must watch on the non-HD FOXDeportes channel. Better than nothing! It's actually ok...thanks
49165331_135157007492726784 x	@AriannyCeleste Hey? Let the East Coast players on Comcast know that they can see some action of FoxDeportes on channel 584 or similar
49165331_134592414483623937 x	@NASDAQBEAR I agree. It's worth it
49165331_134446606241120257 x	@MikeTyson I'm on it. Thanks. AC360 is on now.

49165331_130762289090539520 x	@AriannyCeleste You're heart is the best...and most likely reflects the truth :)
49165331_130745205581283328 x	@danawhite Great production. It gave me goose bumps and I'm not even part of the UFC company. Best of luck and continued success. Can't wait
49165331_130450403799220224 x	@danawhite That was great showing by Cerrone. He proved himself tonight!
