25982774_391342443163308034 x	Kubiak will enter this week with a much more realistic appraisal of the capabilities of his starting QB and will call game accordingly
25982774_391343676322226176 x	@A_Dawg55 Haven't looked at potential replacements close enough. Schaub is their biggest problem. Time to move on
25982774_391349625556598784 x	@A_Dawg55 he has had a lot of shots, though. Epitome of a franchise that needs to go back to rock bottom to get a franchise QB
25982774_388315706124562432 x	Really wonder if Twitter/texts have killed our ability to digest a message that does not explicitly state its thesis within 140 characters
25982774_395352690567290880 x	Replacement plane: The Pete Kozma of planes? RT @SportsCenter: St. Louis Cardinals will board replacement plane to fly to Boston
25982774_388448189764104192 x	To expand on Liriano profile: low enough stock for a single digit AAV on 1 or 2 years. Didn't think Johnson/Jimenez/etc fit that

25982774_364434346343931904 x	Seriously, though, Bastardo was arguably having better season than any pitcher on the roster. Than any reliever, inarguably.
25982774_364432853951455232 x	With the news of Antonio Bastardo's suspension, is the Phillies' 2013 season now tainted? Lines are open

25982774_362384765099319298 x	In case Lee talks heat up, worth noting that Red Sox took Jackie Bradley Jr. one pick after Phillies took Larry Greene in '11 draft
25982774_362298683527671809 x	Jeff Francoeur just saw Michael Young walk onto the field and yelled, "Jesus Christ! You're still here?"

25982774_240941986155229184 x	Real question isn't whether Utley can field well enough to play 3B instead of 2B. It's whether Galvis can hit well enough to play either

25982774_230366171277443074 x	Put it this way - the Phillies gave up more in Oswalt, Pence and Halladay trades than they got back in this one
25982774_129281148063985664 x	HE IS SPEAKING FIGURATIVELY RT @MikeGarafolo: A storm's a-brewin in Philly. Asante Samuel apparently took shots at the front office today

25982774_288054553952284673 x	RGIII cannot plant on his back half. He just can't. Watch his back half the next time he throws the ball.

25982774_241285603323424768 x	Jimmy Rollins committed both deadly sins today: not giving 110 percent on an inconsequential play and then blowing off the Philly media
