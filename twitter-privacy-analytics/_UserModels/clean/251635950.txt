251635950_394520170318020608 x	@SpikeEskin I would have said yes until Adrian petersons son died. Madden 25 ps4/xbox1
251635950_394514501095407616 x	@SpikeEskin he scares me so much!
251635950_394551339734552577 x	@SpikeEskin I'm glad they converted. What would the upside be if the eagles pulled out a win. They really are terrible.
251635950_394550551176019968 x	@SportsRadioWIP @darealtank78 i don't think its a good thing if they win. No upside really.
251635950_394547485936746496 x	@CSNPhilly all of them!
251635950_394545227094294528 x	Listening to Angelo's voice tomorrow morning! #ThingsBetterThanTheEaglesGame @SpikeEskin @SportsRadioWIP
251635950_394542951877316608 x	This game is the straw that broke the camels back. Will be, what QB will we take in the draft talk the rest of the year @SportsRadioWIP
251635950_394540449131925504 x	@SportsRadioWIP @darealtank78 horrible awareness by him!
251635950_394540148056416257 x	@MBarkannCSN @DeseanJackson10 agreed
251635950_394536989653221377 x	@Ike58Reese chip gets one horribly questionable call per game forgiven. He won't make any more. Hopefully?
251635950_392029722240385024 x	@darealtank78 sometimes i smh and feel bad that you have to sit and listen to Angelo without being able to change the channel or turn himoff
251635950_392028773870501888 x	@TheRealDGunnCSN wow!
251635950_392026455594766337 x	@Ike58Reese please put on some pads and get in there Ike. The team needs you!
251635950_392024357826232320 x	@CSNPhilly tell the Gov. He was so wrong.
251635950_392023867117813760 x	@SportsRadioWIP @BrianJHaddad i dont think we will ever be seeing Barkley again.
251635950_392021017721585664 x	@SpikeEskin @howardeskin, on the bright side. At least Foles helped us decide he's not the future QB next year and helped our draft position
251635950_392018376945848320 x	@SportsRadioWIP @BrianJHaddad that has thrown 2 interceptions on his first drive. How many people are loving Vick now!
251635950_392017464852488192 x	@SpikeEskin @And_Porter when is your next radio broadcast. I want to hear you gloat and rub it in SO MUCH!!!
251635950_392017325773565952 x	@RealGlenMacnow well that ain't happening
251635950_392013283768938497 x	@SpikeEskin when is your next radio broadcast. I want to hear you gloat and rub it in SO MUCH!!!!
251635950_392011605518876672 x	@JTrotter_54 major understatement.
251635950_392009934927564800 x	@TheRealDGunnCSN beautiful.
251635950_392008736967241728 x	@RoobCSN uh oh. Game over for the birds!
251635950_392007091671818241 x	I'm glad you stood your ground this week @SpikeEskin , even against your peers.  How does vindication feel.
251635950_392007880330977280 x	@SpikeEskin i think Vick is secretly cheering inside. Lol
251635950_392003772031188994 x	@SportsRadioWIP they need to run a few more screens to get things moving.
251635950_390315229386911744 x	@SpikeEskin glad to hear someone with some common sense about the Eagles. I couldn't agree more with everything you've said.
251635950_386960508995522560 x	@CSNPhilly @36westbrook the receivers made him look good.
251635950_386947306387701760 x	@SportsRadioWIP total collapse by the giants. Looked like they just don't care.
251635950_386943914147844096 x	@RealGlenMacnow @MychalKendricks @BrentCelek how worried were you getting?
251635950_386943261103124480 x	@SportsRadioWIP @BigDaddyGraham please don't start this again!
251635950_386939664944599040 x	@CSNPhilly red zone efficiency. Giants
251635950_386938926566744064 x	Biggest difference between eagles and giants is red zone efficiency. May be what decides this game. @Ike58Reese @SpikeEskin @RoobCSN
251635950_386936731259645953 x	@36westbrook good thing there was a penalty. My heart sank when he threw that one!
251635950_386935732440674304 x	@RealGlenMacnow you know it's coming.
251635950_386934622640418816 x	@SportsRadioWIP @BigDaddyGraham all they have to do is throw towards Nate Allen. He's horrible help!
251635950_386931674686427136 x	@Ike58Reese Nate Allen has horrible angle to the ball judgement
251635950_386930762903457792 x	@36westbrook he's been saying it all game
251635950_386928433298944000 x	@SportsRadioWIP @BigDaddyGraham may want to rethink that
251635950_386922354926174208 x	@RoobCSN calm down. Its a 2 minute drill against the giants. I could do it!
251635950_386909696793522176 x	@RoobCSN that was clearly a safety. These refs are terrible. Can that be challenged?
251635950_386907934502174720 x	@Ike58Reese your being to optimistic, they stopped themselves.
251635950_386906186681163776 x	@SportsRadioWIP @BigDaddyGraham what you say on twitter stays on twitter. Ha
251635950_384470802684735488 x	@SteveCPearson @MikeVick amen! It's not his fault. Anyone who knows about football should see he has horrible receivers.
251635950_384456523201925120 x	@jimcramer boooo! Disappointed in you Cramer.
251635950_380874470912950272 x	@gonzoCSN looks like the old folks are taking it to the kids.

251635950_257593496964329473 x	When is Ray D. going to take over the HC position for the eagles. #eaglestalk
251635950_257548946585563137 x	No matter what people say about Michael Vick, you can never criticize his toughness. He takes some massive hits. #eagles
251635950_237715112864129026 x	Go Andy! You tell em who's boss #eagles

251635950_128946035560153088 x	Every day it's a new problem with the @Siriusxm app. The past week I've had three different problems. Today it's looping every minute.
251635950_129963315815395329 x	@SXM_Help sorry I missed your comment. I'm on my iPhone and I only listen to h100. Seems to have lots of issues constantly.
251635950_129689769507688448 x	These protests are getting outrageous. Go home hippies!  Let the intelligent people who actually have an argument protest.

251635950_95594941820043264 x	I wish the Siriusxm app would work right. I'm missing the stern show replay. Please fix it. It just keeps looping!
251635950_77396822804537344 x	@danieltosh thank god, I thought I was the only one who feels that way.
251635950_75750470488047616 x	@danieltosh hard to believe, most likely impossible.
251635950_63734249928400896 x	@NickDutton haven't seen a tweet from you in a while. Hope your doing ok. Did you have any fallout from the recent weather?

251635950_67695803036213248 x	The Siriusxm app is starting to really piss me off. I'm missing the @HowardStern show for the second Monday in a row. Fix it!
251635950_65171425341865984 x	@johnmon1370 @sternshow glad to see I'm not the only one.

251635950_41258077932109824 x	I am so sick of hearing about and seeing Justin Bieber. Shame on him and Usher for exploiting dumb little girls and their parents.

251635950_36837217280196608 x	@rqui Well said Robin, let's just hope he doesn't overwhelm himself with trying to keep it up or else he's going to go crazy
251635950_36826644756832256 x	Just finished watching Red(2008), not bad. Wiki says it only generated $10k at the box office. Ouch
251635950_36817927491694592 x	@robertAbooey What a buzz kill, at least you didn't walk in on him beating off to it.
