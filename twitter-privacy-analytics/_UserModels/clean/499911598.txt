499911598_398165521155112960 x	@LMPongia I'm no expert. But Benjamin Winchester was a real LDS church leader in 1842 in Philadelphia. He did publish books at that time.
499911598_398168209112592384 x	@LMPongia You might check with John Hajicek at http://t.co/Am2jt9qDCF He has a thing for rare Mormon Books. He would have better idea.
499911598_398171061675503616 x	@LMPongia I'll ask around.
