866760072_396075308174303233 x	@RoobCSN @HummerJoey @ezgreene @VojirEsposito There is no trade value for a DE or OLB who can't get to the QB. Couldn't beat Dung Queenlap
866760072_396091124068388864 x	@HummerJoey @RoobCSN @ezgreene @VojirEsposito And by no playing time, you mean disappeared for two years. Not even on the radar.
866760072_396010980314214401 x	@EaglesZerk @TheRealDGunnCSN @CutonDime25 Hard to believe he still leads the league. He's been like a Halloween ghost the past few weeks
866760072_395757736539205632 x	@SI_PeterKing Forget a ring. Give me some of that juice that John Henry was sipping. Were those unicorns in the bleachers?
866760072_394579522487865344 x	Pennsylvania NFL offensive units: Combining for 3 points over 6 quarters so far today #Eaglestalk
866760072_394551779662508032 x	@Ike58Reese Spurrier oooops, I meant Kelly, is in over his head. At least Andy was a legitimate NFL head football coach
866760072_394550555177021440 x	@RoobCSN This guy is lost at the NFL level. Chip Spurrier Petrino
866760072_394546643322040320 x	With current personnel, and no mobility at QB, Chip Spurrier Petrino's " read" option has proven completely illiterate #Eaglestalk
866760072_394540430341074944 x	@Ike58Reese Djax needs to go forward and pick up that first down. #earnyourmoney
866760072_394538607157202944 x	Note to Chip Kelly: You may not have have the personnel to beat Alabama with this offensive system. #Eaglestalk
866760072_394518021500583936 x	What once was a feared, mystical, Chip Kelly offense, is now starting to resemble a bad Three Stooges rerun. ##Eaglestalk
866760072_394515834078781440 x	Is it too soon to call for emergency QB, backup TE, James Casey? #Eaglestalk
866760072_392257223990460416 x	@RoobCSN I've been beating this drum for the last year. This defense, and especially the secondary, only gets better if they get to the QB
866760072_392086254919368704 x	Desperate to help the Eagles win at home. Wear opposing jerseys? Put them in the vistors locker room? Ship wives out of town? #Eagles
866760072_392085099417972736 x	@RoobCSN I would give give you a fighting chance against Damaris Johnson in the open field. Can't we do any better there? Need a spark.
866760072_392043266084208640 x	@dom9brown Cowboys fans in this city are one bad season from AAA ball.
866760072_392024720830627841 x	Is @36westbrook still available as an emergency QB #Eaglestalk
866760072_392023959233105921 x	@RoobCSN Lets try the backup tight end
866760072_392011448488325120 x	Nick Foles went from winning the starting job, to major doubt about his role as a backup. Just a brutal performance #Eaglestalk
866760072_391996565092847616 x	The Eagles should hire a nanny to take care of Desean Jackson's sideline tantrums #EaglesTalk
866760072_391994263753744384 x	@RoobCSN the real question should be when is the last time Demaris Johnson has brought one back, past the 20
866760072_391977084459163648 x	When is the last time the Eagles had an effective return specialist? One who could do dynamic things like bring one past the 20 #EaglesTalk
866760072_389701089551216640 x	@TheRealDGunnCSN Being at an airport before the sun rises, with the Birds in first place in the NFC East, makes it more manageable.
866760072_389471075421405184 x	I have pinpointed the Eagles biggest defensive need for the off-season: A GPS.... To find the QB #EaglesTalk.
866760072_389461248628518912 x	@Ike58Reese That's a roster move you'd make if you were playing your girlfriend and throwing the game.
866760072_389460765385965568 x	RT @TDESPN: Bill O'Brien is as good a football coach as there is. Penn St. is fortunate to have him.
866760072_387009908631404544 x	@jadande Feel awful for Tony after the INT. With the financial issues and going home to the wife, the pain never ends.
866760072_386942207657517056 x	@Ike58Reese Chip lost his playbook and is using one that Andy left behind
866760072_386936457426132992 x	The Eagles could blitz 13 and not get to the QB. It looks like they are trying to penetrate Fort Knox #EaglesTalk
866760072_386931052851527680 x	@TheRealDGunnCSN I've never seen a team consistently bring the house, and not lay a finger on the QB. Unbelievable
866760072_386912364341497856 x	@RoobCSN Just when we thought they couldn't possibly be any worse in the redzone than they were last year...
866760072_386901606899654656 x	@Ike58Reese You can run a 4.1, but if you're afraid to go over the middle or get hit, you can be rendered ineffective #djax
866760072_386901051607375872 x	I don't care how fast you are. If you won't go over the middle, and are afraid to get hit, you can be rendered ineffective . #desean jackson
866760072_385485967874097153 x	NFC East is a unique animal. Peyton Manning hangover, beat the Giants, beat the Bucs, and the Birds face Dallas for division lead. #insanity
866760072_384479843158872064 x	Did angry Greg become a Cowboys fan #EaglesTalk
866760072_384478354621333504 x	@7deucesports @fkins23 Frustrating when your QB has all day and guys still can't get open. This team misses Maclin,as an option, immensely
866760072_384456940690362368 x	Attention Howie Roseman: Banner's Browns are winning, Andy Reid is undefeated, and Barkann could start at safety. Draft wisely #EaglesTalk
866760072_345729709394501632 x	@billmaher Ignorant troll. What's next? Kick someone in a wheelchair? Punch a blind kid? #mahersucks
866760072_265673951638847489 x	I would take Brian Dawkins on a respirator, over any member of this defense. Who cares about President! Give me a leader on D! #EaglesTalk
866760072_262646372409417729 x	Sandy Alert: FEMA has requested disaster relief for the Eagle's secondary and Nnamdi's contract. We are "under water" #EaglesTalk
866760072_257584419467042816 x	I went to my fridge to get a drink. Cole and Babin were on my milk carton! Missing! Sour milk!! #EaglesTalk
866760072_255084497727545344 x	@mikencueCSN Hey Mike! I won the tweet of the day on Post game Live. Is there still an autographed ball, in the mix, as a prize?
866760072_255040400153268224 x	Urgent situation! Missing persons report! Trent Cole and Jason Babin. Overpaid studs have been missing for 3 weeks Please help #EaglesTalk
