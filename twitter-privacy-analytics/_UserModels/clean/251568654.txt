251568654_390290091517943808 x	@GregEllinger I try not to overreact, but ready to blow this team up. Can't watch this mess. No energy in 3rd. Not attacking puck handler.
251568654_390283823986274304 x	Philadelphia Flyers have to be worst team in NHL at puck awareness. Too many players look lost out there.
251568654_388052587167354880 x	@rheahughes Hey Rhea, just wanted to say that I love ya on lunch break. Doing an awesome job. Keep up the great work! Have a good one.
251568654_375209154774044673 x	@rheahughes hey rhea, good morning. Was thinking of slogan 2013 Eagles "chips in, ante up!
251568654_373034355859656704 x	@rheahughes this is the deli that got hit. I was delivering next door and saw it all happen. Pretty scary. http://t.co/WWQCu9YSXj
251568654_373035914685349888 x	@rheahughes he was coming down Montgomery ave speeding and blew the light. Jammed on breaks and went right through.
251568654_373037672123887617 x	@rheahughes no, nobody standing on that side of store. Lots of shook up people, that's it. Loudest noise I've ever heard.
251568654_373038805227679744 x	@rheahughes hope I'm not bothering you, just wanted to let you guys know.
251568654_373038721991737344 x	@rheahughes driver didn't speak English, so nobody could figure out why he did it, at least while I was there. I had to get back to work.
251568654_373038487387508736 x	@rheahughes yes, including me. I was delivering at flower store, next to deli. Missed me and my truck by about 20 feet.
251568654_373035654651072512 x	@rheahughes video of about 10 seconds after crash, not of actual crash.
251568654_373035504381730816 x	@rheahughes yes, it was. I have 5 minutes of video, but I'm new to twitter and didn't know how to send it.
251568654_53252938491113472 x	Don't understand anything.
