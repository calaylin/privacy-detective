1004836855_281205526438756352 x	@JesusZoidberg Keep my name out of your tweets; you disgraceful human being
1004836855_281191266534965248 x	@JasonBabin93 Big fans of yours dude, keep up the good wok
1004836855_281143262394335232 x	@AlbertBreer Entitled, probably nothing. The fact that the Jets enticed him to come to NY over Jacksonville and won't play him. something
1004836855_281141614964006912 x	@AlbertBreer @OverTheMonster Except they believed that probably 10 weeks ago, still went with Sanchez
1004836855_281129715195068416 x	#FreeTebow
1004836855_281095738593787904 x	@AdamSchein I'm available
1004836855_280868196297347074 x	I'd start Ric Flair over Mark Sanchez, and he'd probably steal my wife
1004836855_281095609275015168 x	@BaconSports It's true.
1004836855_280886285709762562 x	I can't take this anymore. An NFL team trying to get to the playoffs, keeps the worst QB I have ever seen in.
1004836855_280884643065126912 x	@nfl If someone votes for someone from this game for the Pro Bowl they should have their hands cut off
1004836855_280769137427484675 x	@BobShinnRT_R @meechone @poster_nutbag @FanSince09 I don't swing that way, fella
1004836855_280883797963182080 x	@lawlornfl @RoobCSN Foley is light years better then these guys. I'd take Ray Lucas over Sanchez
1004836855_280882164084645888 x	Boy this game is dreadful. I'd rather hear the Michigan fight song on repeat then watch this slop
1004836855_280866920985665536 x	Hell, right now I'd start @MVFive over Mark Sanchez, and I say that knowing Marcus would steal my TV.
1004836855_280878342922719233 x	How is Justin Zwick not working yet these guys for the Jets are. Amazing
1004836855_280875662003294208 x	@nickrock23 Joey everyday
1004836855_280868348202459136 x	Seriously, a QB watching Mark Sanchez is like a doctor watching Helen Keller perform open heart surgery
1004836855_280864974702784512 x	Right now, I'd take myself off the street over Mark Sanchez
1004836855_280864105072558080 x	@EvanMathis69 @EASPORTS @mattyice504 Haven't played Madden since they rated me a 58 in 2003, worse than Chad Hutchinson!
1004836855_280822169821396993 x	And that's not a knock on Ponder, just the large double standard many people have.
1004836855_280821716878503936 x	If Christian Ponder was black, they'd be calling him a bust by now. #DoubleStandard
1004836855_280772031224610817 x	@notkerouac @DennisDeitch Who is Dennis Ditch?
1004836855_280821617846800385 x	@malyanakian @notkerouac @DennisDeitch @FanSince09 @meechone @poster_nutbag You didn't check with me, liarman
1004836855_280778347611582464 x	@fansince09 and his ilk not only mock legends, but now have moved onto mocking Jesus!
1004836855_280778146414985220 x	But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 19:14
1004836855_280777988570767361 x	But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Matthew 6:33
1004836855_280777776800337920 x	Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  John 14:6
1004836855_280776066753236992 x	@JesusZoidberg Show some respect for the Lord and Savior. Worse than @fansince09 mocking Paterno. Scumbags
1004836855_280777510294278144 x	@JesusZoidberg @FanSince09 You have Jesus Christ, the man who died for our sins, as a fishman. It's a mockery!
1004836855_280775890466656256 x	I see what people warned me about; alot of nutcases. SMDH
1004836855_280775699458048000 x	@JesusZoidberg Look at this guy, mocking Jesus Christ by making him some lobster man. You're mocking GOD, and you want to talk.
1004836855_280774472506699777 x	@DennisDeitch @notkerouac Is Dennis Ditch verified?
1004836855_280773781969055744 x	@Kgeich67 @FanSince09 I used to call him Kamala, and he used to call me Kim Chee
1004836855_280772066515501056 x	@meechone Gruden
1004836855_280769700932243456 x	PROTECTED
1004836855_280770043225178112 x	@FanSince09 @BobShinnRT_R @meechone @poster_nutbag You talk bad about good people like Paterno.
1004836855_280770701722537984 x	@FanSince09 @BobShinnRT_R @meechone @poster_nutbag What do you know about couching? Bet you still live with your momsy
1004836855_280771318146809856 x	@FanSince09 @BobShinnRT_R @meechone @poster_nutbag You spend your time taking down people better than you.
1004836855_280770580788170752 x	@notkerouac @FanSince09 I'm in the HOF already, the Ohio State HOF
1004836855_280770505781440512 x	@malyanakian I think Andy needs to go spend time with his family
1004836855_280769827113664512 x	@Greg_Shields Rather not say, but he was very different in private then public
1004836855_280769604396146688 x	@FanSince09 @BobShinnRT_R @meechone @poster_nutbag Donovan is a decent guy, likes to mope though. Hated Philly
1004836855_280769077063086080 x	@Greg_Shields Love Philadelphia
1004836855_280767661967831042 x	Some of my least favorite people when I played: Tim Couch, Ricky Watters, Rodney Pette's wife
1004836855_280768505098412033 x	@DanParzych When her husband was benched she actually went into to Jon Gruden's office and complained
1004836855_280768098477420544 x	@BobShinnRT_R @meechone @poster_nutbag @FanSince09 Just a not nice dude.
1004836855_280767476109819904 x	@BobShinnRT_R @meechone @poster_nutbag @FanSince09 Tim Couch was a jerk. Not good people
1004836855_280766502859309056 x	@BobShinnRT_R @meechone @poster_nutbag @FanSince09 No favorites. Least favorite was the one to Jesse Armstead pick 6
1004836855_280766283274928131 x	@BobShinnRT_R @FanSince09 How is knocking him playing respects. Guy was a great couch, a better man
1004836855_280766101804175361 x	I thought twitter would be this neat exchange of ideas, not this misogynistic attitude of people.
1004836855_280764742841298944 x	@poster_nutbag @meechone @FanSince09 @Slate I don't even know what slate is
1004836855_280765792050622465 x	@meechone @poster_nutbag @FanSince09 @Slate 7, proves nothing though.
1004836855_280765416090005505 x	Thanks to my followers for pointing out this "fan" @fansince09. It's sad that people like him exist and ruin it for everybody else
