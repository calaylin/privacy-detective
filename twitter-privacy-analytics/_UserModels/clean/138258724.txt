138258724_398580367323459584 x	@wonbyone_jn316 so fanciful.....a wooden boat of those dimensions to this day cannot be built - what's Noah's secret?
138258724_398592050389450752 x	@wonbyone_jn316 you people?? Would you like to start that sentence again? I approach the supernatural with scepticism - why wouldn't you?
138258724_398598600176828416 x	@wonbyone_jn316 correct you 'believe' - doing so without (often in spite of) evidence is the literal definition of delusion.
138258724_398602241134702593 x	@wonbyone_jn316 I don't question your sincerity - I just questions your reasons of belief. take care.
138258724_398648459999199233 x	@wonbyone_jn316 you're right, many stories-no evidence. In a library I like to know if I'm in fiction, non-fiction, reference or articles.
138258724_398783705126166528 x	@wonbyone_jn316 why must you veer off topic and dodge questions - is your faith so flimsy that simple questions rattle you?
138258724_398782911853244416 x	@wonbyone_jn316 the evidence for evolution is overwhelming - your failure to understand it does not make it less true.
138258724_398598098647121920 x	@wonbyone_jn316 What is the difference between 'feeling the power' and a psychological condition?
138258724_398597807369502722 x	@wonbyone_jn316 you people - is usually highly pejorative!  I do not claim God does not exist - rather I (like you) have no evidence of this
138258724_398592334385803264 x	@wonbyone_jn316 again you offer rhetoric but can't answer simple questions. Where is your evidence? How could such a boat be built?
