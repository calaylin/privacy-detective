28417631_140586670318821378 x	I will be glad NBA hoops is back but the arrogance of choosing Christmas Day for grand return is beyond ridiculous for me.

28417631_390093787583610880 x	So after a summer of him drinking the Vick Kool-Aid, now Angelo is passing out Foles cups? I'm confused! @WIPMorningShow
28417631_396260545038266368 x	I'm joining the @WIPMorningShow now
28417631_390988748445720576 x	If parents today stopped trying to be friends with their kids and actually parented them we could get next generation on the rails!
28417631_390989378799304704 x	@jetblackbrian you actually think this is a debatable topic?
28417631_389570447521886208 x	I'm switching to the ALCS game just in case a halftime lecture on the Government Shutdown or Redskins nickname is in order.
28417631_387270539850440704 x	@howardeskin why would anyone ask that when he can't coach in college until January 2015?
28417631_367708285954035712 x	Albert Pujols must have a very busy lawyer who has not been able to file that lawsuit paperwork yet. Still waiting!

28417631_392278537342042113 x	Dear NFC Wildcard Hopefuls, 49ers play Jax Sunday & will be 6-2 at bye. There is only 1 spot available.
28417631_392286272808824832 x	@JPCSR30 that was my call pre-season and they will be a home dog
28417631_293834914850279425 x	These conspiracy theories attacking the character of Bill Callahan a decade later sound cowardly and idiotic. Weak!
28417631_293856351040450560 x	@JPCSR30 I agree, improvement. BUT it signals the beginning of the end as it is clear that Jerry is coaching the team.
28417631_291609124570009601 x	@skliesen the day Reid was hired I hated it too. I will be pleased if this proves me to be just as wrong
28417631_290568151073185792 x	Congrats @M_Ryan02  Answering all the critics and getting things done in the clutch!
28417631_400044904056758272 x	Notice stadium project with City Council involvement is already 200M more than originally projected before a shovel hits dirt.
28417631_394606291437383680 x	Watch your fingers, a window is closing.
28417631_394414036931973120 x	If a college coach wants students to honor "written agreements" then they should also practice what they preach.
28417631_392419875509260289 x	Imagine if the Grambling State players had thought to reach out to "Grambling Greats" last week before they acted like children.
28417631_369855660625641472 x	So once again an NFL Coach has looked folks in the eye and is selling the "new" Mike Vick theme. Must not have a search engine.
28417631_369857515464318976 x	@redschmidt27 AMEN, love my SF Red Bull a few days a week
28417631_303105728523141120 x	I am a devout #Phillies fan and believe that they are already a #toetag team in the NL for 2013. @CBSSportsRadio

28417631_379416099248689152 x	Gotta love folks being defensive and hurt over Chip Kelly criticism. This is a job folks, pro football. Get praised, get ripped.
28417631_379337549703315456 x	You can tell Chip Kelly did not coach in a lot of close games at Oregon. Amateurish clock management. Ridiculous use of timeouts.
28417631_377564037254742016 x	Dear RG3, you got your butt kicked because you played poorly and your coaches had you ill prepared. The brace is an excuse. Own it.
28417631_372141596998762496 x	@chuckwoolery @TonyBrunoShow Imagine, I have to show ID to buy decongestant and people claim it is racist to require it to vote!
