16744854_389388983920128000 x	Wanna hear something ironic? The past two years were my most successful to date in terms of money and material items. I wasn't happy though
16744854_389384367526514690 x	But I'm maturing and in time, I will grow into myself.
16744854_389383979893145600 x	In short, I'm going through growing pains in front of the world. Business puberty so to speak. Not the easiest phase of my career...
16744854_389383601990557698 x	In order for me to progress and grow I had to step out of my comfort zones. Rap is a comfort zone for me. I want to expand beyond that....
16744854_389383217469337602 x	I have learned many different things these past few years. Business is not as simple as most assume. Creative ventures are not guaranteed...
16744854_389382426679472128 x	Repeating the same actions gets the same results. Even with success. I was never satisfied with that. I have to risk failure to move beyond.

16744854_388671169160679425 x	@rebeckabarnes2 The trick is too never let go.
16744854_387244600433180672 x	Social Media reminds me of channel surfing. Ton of commercials, plenty of mindless shows but once in awhile you find something interesting.

16744854_388670657287843841 x	@MrMaG254 Smart man.
16744854_388663150200897536 x	Quick Update: I'm working on a new album. An amazing one in fact. It's called Genius Child. I'm fulfilling a promise made to a great friend.
16744854_388659431728115712 x	How many times can you pull the same rabbit out of the hat? I'm always in search of the "next". Makes no sense to repeat the same actions.
