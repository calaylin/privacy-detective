713489633_396030609555877889 x	@Bryan__Bellamy @billmeltzer @RealRocket22 Richards sucks, he's a Jonathan Toews wannabe.
713489633_396043716575887360 x	@Bryan__Bellamy @billmeltzer @RealRocket22 He's #3 at best. For the money we invested in him you think he would have put out more pts.
713489633_396082247335686144 x	@Bryan__Bellamy @billmeltzer @RealRocket22 The only thing Richards brought to the table was worth ethic with above average skills.
713489633_396081647592169472 x	@Bryan__Bellamy @billmeltzer @RealRocket22 More accomplished at every level. At the 2010 Olympics Toews was Canada's best player by far.
713489633_396080977933770752 x	@Bryan__Bellamy @billmeltzer @RealRocket22 He won a Cup because of Kopitar, Brown, and Quick. Was along for the ride. Toews is 1000x better.
