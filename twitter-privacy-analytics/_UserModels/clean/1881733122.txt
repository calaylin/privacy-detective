1881733122_396683512881111040 x	@NHLFlyers @PhantomsHockey keep mcginn up and trade hartnell for a bag of pucks. Itll send a message and save $.
1881733122_396664999936282624 x	@sbaickerCSN what emery did was one reason why fans loved hextall. He was mean and nasty just like most of the beloved broadstreet bullies
1881733122_396468889586262016 x	@RealGlenMacnow ed needs to sell the team. Until he is gone, they will not win. Simple as that.
1881733122_396467617181220864 x	@RealGlenMacnow @sbaickerCSN I don't blame holmgren as much as I do snider. Ed wanted brzy and going all in on him set this franchise back.
1881733122_396452991978717184 x	@urgeok81 @sbaickerCSN whoa calm down buddy sports are supposed to be a positive distraction. Might I suggest yoga or stiff drink
1881733122_396002285597511681 x	@RealGlenMacnow no vote for twix or any fruit-like candy (sour patch kids)
1881733122_396001491640524800 x	@DHock1005 @MBarkannCSN I second the Nirvana vote. They gave a voice to a generation.
1881733122_395755127828922368 x	@ShaneVictorino Congrats on a great night!
1881733122_395747474067185664 x	@RealGlenMacnow Atleast he is taking care of things somewhere, he's definitely not handling stuff on the field.
1881733122_395685750442037248 x	@Ike58Reese hear you with the draft but between the phillies regression, eagles rebuild, and the flyers getting set back w/bryz- I need +`s
1881733122_395004141195767808 x	@JasonCNewsted yes! m/ You should tell mike to get a hold of aaron lewis and go on tour with staind. I'd be there in a heartbeat.
1881733122_395002917348192257 x	@RobZombie too bad I dont get that channel. Btw, I saw Lords of Salem over the weekend and I'm still thinking about it. Have to re-watch.
1881733122_394927290851020801 x	@RealGlenMacnow @1milli_for_me  Vick has an arm, can run, and he is tough. Those traits are the only positives about his game. Not a winner
1881733122_394637823217008640 x	@RoobCSN @GeoffMosherCSN it's not like they set passing records, and in a close game, why did kelly ignore the run?
1881733122_394635506887442432 x	@FalconsMMoore Falcons had 292 yards and I guessed 297. Did anyone else get closer?
1881733122_394619890772242432 x	@RoobCSN @t_bobroski most of the problems that plagued vick as a falcon are still with him today. He is who he is. Vick = athlete not a qb
1881733122_394617368938549248 x	@sbaickerCSN @PearlJam  i always liked corduroy
1881733122_394535361013370880 x	@FalconsMMoore @Atlanta_Falcons 297 yards; 16pts
1881733122_394471397424394240 x	@sbaickerCSN Brz let in softies at the wrong time (I.e. Hextall towards the end), couldn't make a breakaway save, and rarely "stole" a game.
1881733122_393786084821598208 x	@GeoffMosherCSN @CSNPhilly vick has something to prove, and I wouldn't be surprised if he plays well for a game or 2. It'll be short lived
1881733122_393557543081226240 x	@sbaickerCSN I bet girouxs hand factors in quite a bit. Severing tendons of his shooting hand, in august, doesn't bode well for his shot.
1881733122_392721947626577920 x	Took me a while to find @staindmusic self-titled album but I have been listening to it a lot. You guys need to tour again soon. #saverock
1881733122_392471623913472000 x	@EmpireBrewTim @RobZombie I haven't seen Lords ... yet but so far Devil's Rejects is my favorite out of the lot.
1881733122_391777209796788224 x	@BigDaddyGraham I can't hate. He helped bring a WS to philly. Its not his fault amaro has made poor decisions.
1881733122_391357514073526272 x	@sbaickerCSN They should open with Not for you.
1881733122_391356000886071296 x	@SonnieBeverly @secupp  So much hate. Take some deep breathes and chill out.
1881733122_391308462535475200 x	@secupp I see both sides of the fence therefore I can't say either way. If they do, countless other teams will feel pressure to follow.
1881733122_391223391837237248 x	@sbaickerCSN Have you seen Twenty the documentary about Pearl Jam? If not, look it up.
1881733122_391006537340436480 x	@TabernacleATL @JasonCNewsted
1881733122_390998592972144640 x	@NHLFlyers wonderful. A guy who really needs to step up takes a step back.
1881733122_390973684913283073 x	@NBCSports @NHL @NHLFlyers the flyers and penguins are playing tonight and it's not nationally showcased? Wow, talk about marketing!
1881733122_390944009344274432 x	@Metallica @JasonCNewsted after 15 years of owning garage inc., I finally read the cd booklet. I enjoyed my history lesson.
1881733122_390905966180724736 x	@sbaickerCSN  exactly. This is a young team and patience is a must. Making moves to win now typically backfires: sharp, bob, williams etc.
1881733122_390649765589184512 x	@secupp they don't even compete with brian wilson and is awesome.
1881733122_390277028626591744 x	@NHLFlyers why was this guy wasting away in the minors to start the season? He deserved an honest shot after last year. Keep it up mcginn!
1881733122_390194423705124865 x	@RealRocket22 do you think the flyers made a mistake by signing streit? I think gus needs to play.
1881733122_390005599666438144 x	@deftones if I didnt have class Wednesday morning, I'd be at lakewood later tonight.
1881733122_389876947469484032 x	Yo @doolucks check out your boy's new movie https://t.co/g8kMWp2FIn
1881733122_389782153531518976 x	@ThatKevinSmith beating the russians? Maybe you should thank the broad street bullies. J/k
1881733122_389480375057416193 x	@RoobCSN  Foles is a QB and Vick is an athlete. Try to keep that in mind.
1881733122_389193314681257984 x	@NHLFlyers And this guy hasn't been able to crack the lineup until now.
1881733122_389192868403109888 x	@CSNPhilly @TheRealDGunnCSN @RoobCSN father time makes a difference.
1881733122_389153961212518401 x	@Talkmaster @ajc I have read about these occurances way too many times. It is sickening and I bet the former dog owners are completely SOL
1881733122_389055727232647168 x	@sbaickerCSN if I was the chief: mcginn, giroux, voracek; read, couturier, simmonds; rinaldo, bschenn, raffl; rosehill, talbot, hall
1881733122_388817251341987840 x	@sbaickerCSN @mharrisCSN not sure. I am only able to listen to the games. IMO the young guys and defense need to step up. If not, bad news.
1881733122_388678296424431616 x	@sbaickerCSN @933WMMR thanks for the tip.
1881733122_388676561794502656 x	@secupp @CNN some people just love pigeonhole others
1881733122_388507066329202688 x	@TabernacleATL reggae
1881733122_388093413075456000 x	@sbaickerCSN looks like a cooler version of yoshi with a football.
1881733122_387791672807264256 x	@sbaickerCSN it's nice to hear a flyers goalie came up with a big save on a breakaway and stole a game for the flyers cough (bryz)
1881733122_387738956823277568 x	@TabernacleATL  Third World- 96 degrees
1881733122_387702164468269056 x	@NHLFlyers @CSNPhilly @975TheFanatic hopefully they will not make history in a negative light tonight.
1881733122_387664924887224320 x	@RealGlenMacnow last week, the bengals losing to the browns got me kicked out. This week the bengals beat the patriots.
1881733122_387425752234598400 x	@SportsRadioWIP freddy garcia and jaiquawn jarrett both doing fairly well tonight for other teams. Lucky Philly teams/fans.
1881733122_387410940171677696 x	@Braves nice play to get puig at 2nd
1881733122_387406695540224000 x	@RealGlenMacnow he's your boy!
1881733122_387406311224516608 x	@NHL @NHLDevils  good for him. Always my favorite non-flyer hockey player.
1881733122_387333916082073600 x	@simonpegg I think it's funny when someone corrects a typo and ironically includes a typo of their own.
1881733122_387317105647173632 x	@RealGlenMacnow You're lucky foles got in the game. I don't think Vick would've won the game.
1881733122_387316472730898432 x	@yadie77 @Metallica Me too. I've been listening to all my Metallica CDs nonstop since. @Metallica please tour the south east (Ga) soon.
1881733122_387315219984560128 x	@sbaickerCSN  The flyers need to learn how to break out of their end. Defensive teams (devils) make them look like fools and lavy stayed pat
1881733122_386717270313287680 x	@doolucks I never got to hear your full ranking of Tarantino movies. If I have the wrong person, please ignore this haha
1881733122_386304693959659520 x	@Braves aw yeah, making it a series!
1881733122_386301766117363712 x	@Braves nasty stuff to shumaker
1881733122_386296272451555328 x	@MLB @HanleyRamirez @Braves nail bitter.
1881733122_386223781666390016 x	@sbaickerCSN If bryz was bothered with Philly's lack of a defensive scheme, he better get ready for even less help with echl players.
1881733122_386160872047247360 x	@Metallica I am still thinking bout Through the Never. I haven't been able to see you play live since the st. Anger tour 03, next best thing
1881733122_386150842749161473 x	@TheRealDGunnCSN not be surprised. A Swiss cheese secondary, an athlete (not a QB) running the show, and just one player in McCoy = bad.
1881733122_385939336384221184 x	@Metallica Awesome show/movie! Thanks for playing Orion.
1881733122_385856252758081536 x	@Eagles should sign josh freeman and release vick. Let foles start a couple games and then name freeman the starter in a few weeks.
1881733122_385838177916698624 x	@Metallica I am stoked about going tonight. I wonder if anyone will mosh haha
1881733122_385622959165284352 x	@MaiRichardson5 I also hard that song has no special meaning, it just flows.
1881733122_385594255177428992 x	@sbaickerCSN coburn, the schenns, and couturier  really need to step it up this season. If those guys turn into duds, the flyers are SOL.
1881733122_385567113043517440 x	@RealGlenMacnow Wow, you really don't like that guy. It was ruben' s fault. Young is a DH nothing more.
1881733122_385510717463728128 x	@NHLFlyers Flyered up for the start of the season. The only better time of year is the start of the NHL playoffs.
1881733122_385059267377897472 x	@sbaickerCSN how does gill look on the ice? The last thing the flyers need is a human pylon a la hatcher and rathje.
1881733122_385032557429284864 x	@RealGlenMacnow @JasonBabin93  if things don't turn out, he can always go run with the bulls.
1881733122_385031495364386816 x	@simonpegg @markydonovan That was the second album I ever bought. Haha awesome movie
1881733122_384782643940057088 x	@Ike58Reese @MrtnJared The quality of the defense a team plays against is a huge factor affecting points and Chip's genius.
1881733122_384427866358026240 x	@Eagles First carry and a TD. I think polk has earned a few more touches.
1881733122_383946764895932416 x	@sbaickerCSN He should be. Laviolette's system is one their main problems. Any defensive team ie NJ can easily beat this team.
1881733122_383785460708814848 x	@RoobCSN This a result of rubens moves. He took a team built around power hitting and neutered them in the name of starters and a closer
1881733122_383773208736194560 x	@NHLFlyers  it's their system. Nj was able to dismantle them in the playoffs two years ago and now other teams have caught on.
1881733122_383644566559006720 x	@JasonCNewsted  every metalhead should listen to Anesthesia today.
1881733122_382944501494738945 x	@RealGlenMacnow  The Delorean from Back to the?Future.
1881733122_382632194407415808 x	Yo @JennaaOlsonn what's good? We only saw each other twice this summer at the Cooler. I hope you enjoy going to UGA.
1881733122_382630453024653312 x	Excited about the NHL starting soon. Go @NHLFlyers
1881733122_382350563935268864 x	DRC looked pretty good tonight too bad the @Eagles couldn't figure out how to use him.
1881733122_382349351668166656 x	@BigDaddyGraham  Ray Bourque
1881733122_381876607042224128 x	Rise up! Get to see what firefighter Watkins does for miami. Haha
1881733122_380937028021784576 x	Brutal game and saw this coming a while away. Its a shame but that's life.
