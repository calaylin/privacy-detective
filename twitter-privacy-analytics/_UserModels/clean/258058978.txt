258058978_146019799468740611 x	@jmac_18 how the hammy now?
258058978_145985686728736768 x	@CSNPhilly St Joe's beat an undefeated, ranked team. Temple beat a weak Nova team. Definitely St Joe's
258058978_145943726831833091 x	@BobGrotz you forgot hustle.
258058978_145930541491961858 x	@robellis610 hey rob, is he the biggest free agent bust in Eagles history? For the amount of $$$ and the lack or production, I think so
258058978_145930130773131265 x	@RoobCSN that's because he is ordinary. What a waste of money. Lurie should be sick to his stomach paying that guy each week
258058978_145929766850146304 x	@BobGrotz he may be the biggest free agent bust in Eagles History
258058978_145929637489414145 x	@Ike58Reese he might be biggest free agent bust in Eagles history. Wow!!
258058978_144625111524311041 x	@JamieApody @6abc I think SJU might be best team in the Big 5. Do you?

258058978_142441410442956800 x	@Ike58Reese time to bench him in the 4th
258058978_142438078513020929 x	@jeffskversky there's no place like home for the holidays

258058978_141311636110716928 x	@RoobCSN my God.....he's delusional
258058978_140995184572903424 x	@RoobCSN it's hard to be a season ticket holder.  Reid cannot beat an elite coach with an elite QB.
258058978_140979714335580160 x	@howardeskin will he get paid next year?  I hope not
258058978_139199744034615298 x	@jmac_18 @prestonsteve933 just make sure you're on the field Sunday

258058978_138730328540983296 x	@JillianNBC10 too plain and too dark. Its hard to go retro when they've been wearing same unis for 45 years
258058978_138767691296161793 x	@JillianNBC10 I am looking forward to watching HBO 24-7 show about Flyers and Rangers
258058978_138765190677266432 x	@AnthonySan37 when does HBO start filming 24-7?
258058978_138442530663575552 x	@Ike58Reese big red will still keep passing
258058978_138429293066858497 x	@jameernelson they may be for real this year. Playing Nova on Hawk Hill. Gonna be awesome
258058978_137680619604951041 x	@jameernelson carl jones looks like he might be the real deal...you might get schooled
258058978_137679729296818176 x	@ESPNLunardi the hawks look damn good right now too
258058978_137679195236085760 x	@HamillHimself well deserved! Did you see carrie fisher vs bill shatner war of words?
258058978_137677946084261888 x	@jameernelson hawks looking great 2night vs seton hall
258058978_136776948352421888 x	@KScott6abc be careful
258058978_135962549899366400 x	@howardeskin Andy won't have Joe Paterno and Jerry Sandusky to take heat off him this week
258058978_135114021404811264 x	@Jim_Gardner @robcorujo give him a break....he lives in Springfield Delco
258058978_133959142338600960 x	@johnclarknbc10 he would get slaughtered so bad, it would be elder abuse
258058978_133958915489673216 x	@LesBowen that's great. They got plenty of time
258058978_133958691035693057 x	@jeffskversky they can't put that old man in front of that media horde. They had to cancel. JoePa may never be seen in public again
258058978_133953426391437312 x	@RoobCSN haha good one man! Maybe he can give JoePa pointers on not answering ?non-football& related questions
258058978_133776974018654208 x	@howardeskin who was worse Desean Jackson or Rogers Cromartie?

258058978_133757626969366528 x	@jeffskversky down goes Frazier
258058978_133743272815378432 x	@RoobCSN horrible decision to a) catch the punt b) go backwards c) not tuck it and d) to freakin fumble it. Hasn't contributed all year
258058978_133734538336673793 x	@LesBowen I'm here in 213...kolb could cover better than DRC
258058978_132302386466275328 x	@amyfadoolCSN @philaunion sorry but that's just a stupid system
258058978_132302087928291328 x	@AnthonySan37 yeah, where was Jagr?
258058978_132300884305657856 x	@RoobCSN I honestly don't care what they think about the fans.  As long as they play hard, I'll always root for them.
258058978_132300112876670976 x	@howardeskin agreed...a SS, LF, 3B, a closer and 7th inning pitcher.  Need new blood who REALLY want to win
258058978_132299660005093376 x	@CecilyTynan you looked great as usual
258058978_131863037631143937 x	@dtapp55 he's good but your Rb is much much better...see ya Monday night

258058978_130126115632185344 x	@howardeskin total meltdown and collapse. Reminiscent of Red Sox -Buckner
258058978_130125760362057728 x	@jmac_18 hate to say it but they deserve it. Wow man!
258058978_130123244467523584 x	@VANIMAL_49 hate to say it but they deserve it
258058978_129319973955964928 x	@CutonDime25 yes, he is! Now keep it going so they can say you're over-rated next year. Haha
258058978_126786263658409985 x	@RoobCSN so sad. He's delusional

258058978_125734675456073728 x	@EvanMathis69 my God, we needed that. Enjoy the bye and kill the cowboys
258058978_122667376109043712 x	@howardeskin absolutely does, he screwed up the lineup and made no adjustments. Pence played like he's been a Phillie for 3 years
258058978_122667097863094273 x	@StarJonesEsq a world series with the yankees and phillies would have been BORING and I'm a Phillies fan
258058978_122532211382697984 x	@howardeskin what do you expect. He's friends with them all.
258058978_122531941554716672 x	@Ike58Reese heart and soul?! This team has NO heart. They choked under pressure 2 years in a row and the "leadership" did nothing to stop it
258058978_122520836325388289 x	@HunterPence3 Eat This, Hunter!!

258058978_122520348238417920 x	@ryanlawrence21 he shoulda struck out looking
258058978_122513302571065344 x	@howardeskin they would have lost to whatever team they played. Doesn't matter. Buncha heartless bums Halladay wishes he was still a BlueJay
258058978_122512890132566016 x	@RoobCSN despicable! Heartless, gutless, elderly chokers
