108318595_393157080112443392 x	LOL. Prob Clemens. ?@Wtmk81: @karabellespn deep league. Can start 3 QBs. Better ROS Campbell or Clemens.?
108318595_393158191330361344 x	Like both! But Dunbar. ?@JayJohns14: @karabellespn Better Hail Mary? Khiry Robinson or Lance Dunbar?
108318595_394488266646634497 x	Good news for Fred Jackson. CJ Spiller is out. That's good for Spiller owners, too. Now you know for sure to sit.
108318595_351129199710445569 x	Darin Ruf having poor at bats again. Not a good year for him. Hey, he's no Delmon.
108318595_335568176165294080 x	I think if you combined Reds and Phillies bullpens and chose top 6 pitchers, Papelbon only Phillie.
108318595_394447779235635200 x	Ellington now. He's starting. ?@CK62: @karabellespn Ruben Randle or A Ellington in the flex ? Non-ppr?
