2158626779_395653686552453121 x	@NatalieEgenolf and the rest.....is history!
2158626779_395955306175672320 x	@MentalityMag O my lord
2158626779_395903684393328641 x	@MentalityMag well based on the pic alone it's WW in a landslide
2158626779_395901857052491776 x	@WIPMorningShow Yes! it's like an alum from your school.You don't always root for their team, but you are always checking the box score.
2158626779_395677092416729089 x	@36westbrook @mort_21 we are blessed with a large number of contenders there.
2158626779_395674815912488960 x	@funnyordie he's always running late.    He'll be late for the ceremony too.   Man, we're talking about PRACTICE
2158626779_395674482443968512 x	@PompeyOnSixers @amyfadoolCSN they likely assumed he'd be sitting by the third quarter anyway...
2158626779_395674286763278336 x	@SpikeEskin watch him have a spectacular year.   Are we being punk'd?!
2158626779_395656724851339264 x	@IamLaceyChabert @edenriegel @Amy_Davidson @HaylieDuff @KaylenDavidson only the luckiest kids will trick or treat at that house!
2158626779_395655884191563776 x	@EaglesInsider he actually did once.   It was terrifying
2158626779_395655134400610304 x	@MentalityMag technically it is reasons 1,999 and 2,000...bit who's counting?
2158626779_395654617398509568 x	@NatalieEgenolf @VictoriasSecret this makes all the sense in the world to me.   I wonder what 'bra' goes for
2158626779_395654057097834496 x	@MentalityMag um....who is this?!
2158626779_395653961803264000 x	@MentalityMag I always lean a little to the left
2158626779_395653824150773760 x	@guyism @MentalityMag @Alyssa_Milano um.   Where is this tape?!
2158626779_395653501201944576 x	@NatalieEgenolf lol
2158626779_395653380494086144 x	@RealGlenMacnow talking about PRACTICE
2158626779_395653194678042625 x	@nufced this seems to be a bit of a trend in the city
2158626779_395580393673338880 x	@The700Level not sure what he has actually done.
2158626779_395580167893954560 x	@MentalityMag stupid is as stupid does...
2158626779_395253797569961984 x	@MentalityMag turn your head and cough!
2158626779_395248837755166720 x	@CrossingBroad he did steal from the NFL for quite some time
2158626779_395243030485401600 x	@FlyEaglesNation we're talking about PRACTICE
2158626779_395235717418598400 x	@SpikeEskin @BrianJHaddad @ForrestGriffin this may describe any team that loses to Sixers this year....
2158626779_395235025522003968 x	@Eagles other than the fact that he thinks he's Batman he ready to roll!
2158626779_395229584117215232 x	@MentalityMag well...,DUH!
2158626779_395222747737235456 x	@CrossingBroad I think there is enough circumstantial evidence to indict the sixers right now.
2158626779_395222174292017152 x	@SportsRadioWIP would be shocked for him not to start
2158626779_395221988127805440 x	@MentalityMag buy me one too?
2158626779_395195218670403585 x	@MentalityMag @KateUpton Ty .,,I'm here all week. :)
2158626779_395195030732025857 x	@SportsRadioWIP @MikeandIke94WIP  think the Phil's with the cash infusion will get there first.  Not sure about timeframe
2158626779_395191818465599488 x	@MentalityMag @KateUpton this is just wrong. She should be cat woman or Wonder Woman or some kind of 'woman' ...not Liz Taylor
2158626779_395190406876758016 x	@MikeandIke94WIP @SportsRadioWIP given the longest tenured Philly coach has only slightly more tenure than I do, and given state of all, 0!
2158626779_395189919037259776 x	@davespadaro @StevenGripp impossible to grade unless he gets full reps for a week or two.
2158626779_395187376773160960 x	@WIPMorningShow this is the only month you could ask this and have it be even close.   Football!
2158626779_395187135869095936 x	@davespadaro @PoundSignLB YES
2158626779_395186441967636480 x	@nufced no way birds are worst disappointment.  4-12 and what is new?  Coach, staff, schemes on both sides of ball.  Same peeps in the nest
2158626779_395185671318818817 x	@WIPMorningShow @rheahughes three: And out.
