303877659_373286940986314752 x	@RoobCSN agree totally with #4. Logan is a player. Lots of good free agents. Liked Maehle too.

303877659_372759348621361152 x	@jtannenwald @phillysport Playsafe mouth guards are the best. A dentist takes impressions.

303877659_371468340784812032 x	@RoobCSN played within himself and smart. Vick looked a little like his old self. Doesn't see the field all the time.
