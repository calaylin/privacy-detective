1927997593_391926681650225152 x	@Briantheg73 that's BS it looked like a sack
1927997593_391921345493090305 x	is that a typo or did they officially announce it as last I knew tamba had 7.5 & Chiefs had 31 team sacks
1927997593_391926498501726208 x	@skripeland agreed that's BS

1927997593_391781191143022592 x	@Houston_Era which is what case has never experienced so while I.like ur optimisation ur going way overboard for a guy in his 1st ever start
1927997593_391780784077434880 x	@Houston_Era this is the big boys lg where guys are bigger stronger & faster & the speed of the game is faster
1927997593_391780569580699648 x	@Houston_Era it on urself bur remember case isn't in College anymore where he can rip up Texas El Paso & others
1927997593_391780385937313792 x	@Houston_Era with that said expect Chiefs Fans to rip u in a new one when it doesn't happen & I won't be here to bail u out as u brought
1927997593_391780152327168000 x	@Houston_Era he may or may not play well but the chances are really low he does good in his 1st game as history proves it
1927997593_391779898995376129 x	@Houston_Era this is possible but to expect that right now is setting yourself up for disappointment when it doesn't happen.
1927997593_391779681428451328 x	@Houston_Era but let's be real he not throwing foe 300 yards or 4 td's not in his 1st game give him a few games & let him develop then
1927997593_391779353148678144 x	@Houston_Era afterall this Chiefs Defense is better then ur giving them credit for. I understand u may be a keenum fan & that's fine
