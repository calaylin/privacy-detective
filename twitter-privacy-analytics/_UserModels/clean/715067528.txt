715067528_237828935759581184 x	@wyche89 @jam1044 @wyche89 @nfl_365 you can't teach an old dog new tricks. He won't slide feet first and takes to long to throw the all.

715067528_232719385670873088 x	@hitmanheil420 @FlyEaglesNation I hope it right. Not hating. I just think that he can do it.
715067528_232695535964938240 x	@QB_Eagles1990 @flyeaglesnation I'm not saying Vicks a bad QB. You got young players around him. He's aging.
715067528_232696454915969024 x	@FlyEaglesNation @qb_eagles1990 I agree. He can't take those hits anymore.

715067528_232324860754415617 x	@FlyEaglesNation I guess he better learn how to kick field goals so he can play till he's 60 years old cause he ain't going to win nothing.
715067528_232136541504409600 x	@squirts82 what a dumb name. Wait till I tell the guys. Hahaha
715067528_231608259805585408 x	How gross it is to sit across someone and see the wax in their ear the size of a nickel. Nasty shit.
715067528_231371583229394944 x	@MikeAndMike it can't b Sanchez because they are not going to replace him with another bum. Go EAGLES.
