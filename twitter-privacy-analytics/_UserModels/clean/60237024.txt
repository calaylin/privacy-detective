60237024_389495395899817984 x	RT @AnaheimDucks: The jerseys are hung and ready. We can't wait to see these on the ice tonight. #ThrowbackNight http://t.co/9lxgWMnVh2

60237024_327013393351462912 x	Now that makes me wonder why they?ve been playing Jay-Z?s ?Public Service Announcement? during Flyers? pregame warmups. #imkidding
60237024_394825289043566592 x	So much is made of #Flyers? D corps personnel, but commitment in all 3 zones by forwards as well carried them in 3rd period of last 2 games.

60237024_390998492908224512 x	Pens have a 17-2 shot advantage in the 2nd. Yikes.
60237024_389206270559133696 x	No matter how you want to view tonight's officiating, that fact isn't up for debate. Good teams wait for the mistake & pounce. 2/2

60237024_351896110878560257 x	Those were the most recent reported numbers per @icemancometh. RT @harphila @AnthonyMingioni Is he asking for 5 years at $5 mil per?
