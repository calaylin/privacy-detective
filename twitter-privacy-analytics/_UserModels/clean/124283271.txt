124283271_392274058131542016 x	@WIPMorningShow Ang, when u returned ur Foles jersey, did they give u a refund?
124283271_392244491694133248 x	Thx to @gingertcg & TCG for treating us to Eagles tix. Great seats. http://t.co/cJRQ5mrfsQ
124283271_392241486840221696 x	@WIPMorningShow 3 possible reasons Foles sucked: He's from TX & his mom is a cowboys fan | Needed to go #2 | He owed $ to a loan shark.
124283271_390565853378674688 x	@MikeMiss975 on board with u on rooting for local teams. What's the protocol for PSU fans that live in philly and never attended it?
124283271_390616267314696192 x	@MikeMiss975 how so Mike? Geo location, pro or college. If u didn't live in a city or attended a school u shouldn't root for that team.
124283271_390627955552321536 x	@MikeMiss975 then keep it local and root for Temple! BTW, thx 4 reply and not big-timing a fan. Cheers.
124283271_384787804158713856 x	@MikeMiss975 had to make silly baby noises not hear u talk about last BB episode. LMK, when ur done #SpoilerAlert  so I can tune u back on.

124283271_380669592567570432 x	@jmbramblings @WIPMorningShow So u'r saying the old GF has a hotter BF than us? After tonight, both will be 2 and 1. Odds will even up.
124283271_381027239993024512 x	@jmbramblings @WIPMorningShow you were right, I was wrong. Our new GF showed her ugly face. Embarrassing. #Eagles
124283271_380836523043995648 x	@donovanjmcnabb tell D Sanders we'll kick our uncle if he's a cowboys fan. Proud u were our QB. Congrats tonight, HOF'er in my book.

124283271_380661882136567808 x	@WIPMorningShow only reason #Eagles need 2 win tonight is for us #EaglesFans getting some closure with Andy. Our psyche is fragile.
