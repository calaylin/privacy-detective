209428983_392848320068345856 x	he he You could not think of anyone you respect more? How about a person that does a size job and never killed any dogs?
209428983_392981492005343232 x	he He can be forgiven, it does not mean I need to give him more respect that anyone else.
209428983_393166921308573696 x	he Thats where we agree I'm saying he has earned less respect from me. I think a lot others want more. I do not hate his guy.
209428983_393191244522086400 x	he as far as ball people go, I agree with you on that one.
209428983_393329067808030720 x	he Fowles looked strange last Sunday but he is taken some good stuff. I'd admit Vick, with that type of offence though.
209428983_392860435625820160 x	he Maybe. Those would be called accidents.
209428983_392862518177456128 x	he limiting ones personal to a size job is an accident? Please elaborate.
209428983_392866238168580096 x	he I agree, but being great at sports does not negate other deficiencies like high character. Thus, Vick having not earned my respect.
209428983_392981910567538689 x	he he yeah, maybe. Doesn't mean he is earned my respect.
209428983_393024783861813249 x	he he possibly. no I still have a hard time thinking he could not think of ANYONE he loves more.
209428983_393030025420623872 x	he he he I've done you I understand but being apologetic will not warrant me praise.
209428983_393040289109381120 x	he I understand you annoy him. That's good. But you said you do not respect anyone more than him. Teachers, firemen, pastors?
209428983_393106625596112896 x	he Pretty much. Kurt Warner is a good one.
209428983_392859406570110977 x	he I do not need to be forgiven.
209428983_392860840418095104 x	he Since when is making dogs for fun perfect behavior? I'd more call that rational behavior.
