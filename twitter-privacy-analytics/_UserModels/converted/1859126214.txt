1859126214_397518017086496768 x	he Philis do not have many songs to upgrade. C/RF are about it. Bc of that, you think maybe Revere could be on his outs?
1859126214_397518835554607104 x	he I'm hoping so. Adding Nelson Cruz and re-signing body part is not enough of an order for his offence IMO. They need more kiss
1859126214_397517722520526849 x	I love Molly Sullivan, he is gorgeous. She lives way too robotic though. Always love that about reporters. It's 2013, talk normal.
1859126214_397513208262443008 x	he Probably. The Warriors are good. They can kiss he lights out and Curry is ridiculous. Some tough games coming up.
1859126214_397501206370594817 x	Knew going into his last two offseasons we were heading for dark days.This season is his last straw.Screw it up and I'm out until RAJ's fired
1859126214_397500664105795584 x	Just giving a Nel Cruz is not going to cut it. offence was abysmal. Not many positions to order other than CF. RAJ loves Revere tho.He sucks.
1859126214_397500183950286848 x	Stuff I learned from Salisbury on WIP today about Philis was much due to his last two offseasons. Not going after his big bats. #sameoldstory
1859126214_397101613669548032 x	As far as I'm concerned, it is his Broncos and then everyone else. Man, there are a lot of bad or mediocre people in his NFL this year
1859126214_397499470591455232 x	he With Tom Brady they are always scary, but their defence is not great and they do not have his jobs in my computer
1859126214_397498874283044864 x	The countdown to another disastrous summer is at just under 6 hours! Join his fun! #worstGMinbaseball
1859126214_397498671073206272 x	Everyone ready to see Ruben Amar Jr fuck up another offseason? #FireAmaro
1859126214_397497581682835456 x	RT he In London, Nutter says location will tour Europe in year URL
1859126214_397493139427962880 x	he Salta and nailsick both suck. Neither really any type of order over what they have.
1859126214_397478354753818624 x	aosmic sucks. Everyone saw that with his Eagles. If anyone makes him a job again, it is for name only. Slow and bad instincts.
1859126214_397201547995512833 x	he I was very impressed, but he has to couple it with more big games. If he sucks between GB, Fowles just another inconsistent QB
1859126214_397203317983416320 x	he Certainly not. Unless he calls super well his rest of his way, I still want another QB in his order round.
1859126214_397200823534379008 x	he Elsberry gets injured a lot and will probably get URL million. Don't you think it is a very risky signing?
1859126214_397178640997183488 x	Don't understand why anyone in his NFL would have long dreads. It makes you a disadvantage as people can buy without penalty. Fuck style
1859126214_397168971629072384 x	Chip Kelly's offence works if his people execute. Always has, always will. Laughing at his short-sighted reactionary idiots from last time
1859126214_397165568773480449 x	You will not hear from all his losers who said Chip is not cut out for his NFL this week. They're too active running his Gus Bus into a firy drive
1859126214_397163471739310080 x	RT he Via he Nick Fowles is his order player in NFL history to put for seven touchdowns within his order three
1859126214_397146601967210496 x	Pryor that fast, his LBs that slow, or both?
1859126214_397145486533992448 x	Eagles a different team on his road. It makes no sense. It's usually infuriating they could not play this way at home.
1859126214_397114596395208704 x	For those that do not know, his PPB man Chris Myers is his best idiot that changed Ian Johnson's project when Boise mention Oklahoma
1859126214_397114324780478464 x	lol, bring a WR when his QB is running backwards. Smart
1859126214_397112046673612800 x	garish Myershhhh. TyouchhhDyooown. Brent Sheeeleeeek. Eagles LEAD cheven nothing
1859126214_397111453838106624 x	I'm Chris Myers, I talk like Chris Hanson. Nick flesh forestish Doyon
1859126214_397110975079276544 x	Chris Myers is such a douchebag.
1859126214_397109952541519872 x	Let's see what Chip has made up on offense!!! Waddy got Chip?!?!?!?!
1859126214_397109035716988928 x	One of his rank rules in fiction sports. MOG GOTTA PROTECT THE PUNTER!!
1859126214_397108363974025216 x	Horrible play calling by SD. Just awful.
1859126214_397106928972599297 x	If his Eagles classify today, time to root for his a draft pick, because Dallas will be design games up and it is over.
1859126214_397103146540871680 x	Why does not NFL Red Zone have his Cowboys/Vikings game on? Stop giving this Titans/Rams game. It's strange
1859126214_397102191174885376 x	he he Goodell's NFL!
1859126214_397101501622919168 x	Goodell's NFL at work in his Jets game! Pathetic
1859126214_397096773149155328 x	laugh his Chiefs are such frauds. Scored two defencive DTs today. They will not win anything with that strange offence
1859126214_397095083851268097 x	The only negative about NFL Red Zone: I hate when they cut in to color zone games that no one knows about. Bad people or blowouts
1859126214_397092884513443840 x	Awful awesome call in his Vikings/Cowboys game. Wow. Just wanted to make sure he was down. I hate his concussion rules. HATE them
1859126214_397092714115641344 x	he Followed by a strange one
1859126214_397091502196654081 x	The Jets are a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde team if I've ever seen one.
1859126214_397088289292705792 x	he What do you think about his Philis losing out on McDowell? Think he used his Philis as leverage to get better deal from Atlanta?
1859126214_397086433971671040 x	Horrible play call by Buffalo and Big Daddy is ENRAGED
1859126214_397084768602300416 x	Liked Dallas -9.5 this week, but glad they are staying an egg anyway. Man, this location sucks. Can't remember when it was this bad.
1859126214_396919421148463104 x	Steve from Glenside talking out of his ass. I was always pretty fine about taking long to take a coach and criticised people that are not
1859126214_397084087380230144 x	he They took their time and made his right move. He seems to be an informative coach. Hunkie is a shrewd person it seems. Good GM
1859126214_397083927854063616 x	he Hope you are right. Eagles people need something to be happy about. If Fowles calls well they have a great shot. Simple key to game
1859126214_396921222170017792 x	for his record, his tanking process is not taken right or wrong until years after his fact when everything calls out. It probably has yet
1859126214_396920189050032128 x	Just mocked people that whined about his playing process with Adam mere minutes before as a matter of fact. Don't make bad up
1859126214_396893264063643648 x	he Money well spent. Glad you enjoy his game. It was a fun game, but I have tunnel vision on Wiggins.
1859126214_396893108735991810 x	he One of those games where if his Skins sit an egg, stay away from them for a while. Hard betting year. So many mediocre people
1859126214_396812058563317761 x	I hate this team. What his fuck are they doing?
1859126214_396816243946057728 x	he Enjoy it while it is happening. They play very hard.
1859126214_396815785814810624 x	Absolutely disgusting. The Sixers will not win a sports in my holiday and I'm not even 30 yet.
1859126214_396810781678788608 x	Derrick Rose has an elastic band growing out of his body part
1859126214_396737909568450560 x	Philis could not even classify McDowell away from Braves. What a strange service this has become. Done nothing right in design years.
1859126214_396733450679369728 x	he Coaching is a high stress job. I wonder if doctors will enjoy him taking his rest of his season off. Can't be good for him
1859126214_396717786161889280 x	Temple going to Temple
1859126214_396570312331890690 x	A lot of his future of Philly sports calls on his next several months. Philis free agency, NBA lotto, Eagles get their QB? Hope for his rank
1859126214_396567494132916224 x	he The Sixers +9 is promising, but be fine cause Sixers might be fool's gold, and Bulls very good when clicking. Not clicking yet.
1859126214_396567027839553536 x	he Sixers could very well win that game. Hard to judge, cause wonder what to make of 6ers yet.I'm a Wiggins person tho,so 3-0 would be UGH
1859126214_396566649983074304 x	he Thanks. I like Skins a TINY bit too,but not a lot. Theyre not great, but SD inconsistent on road. Liked Bills if Lewis calls
