296435885_394525792052719616 x	That went in?
296435885_326142494276468736 x	Smart mood by Dom to NOT fly for that ball. The last time he did that it interested in a bases clearing triple.
296435885_210187364629348352 x	That's application L's in a row for his Phillies! #comeonman
296435885_386912204471418881 x	Gotta make that throw.
296435885_379303864652292096 x	I could not tweet speed enough! TD, Cooper from MV7. Now we are eating with grease. 13-10 Chargers #FlyEaglesFly

296435885_340286637978288128 x	Chad Durbin on his mound now for his Phillies. Time for HEAT/PACERS gm5!
296435885_350409520331243521 x	Welp, look at his bright side, he is only 19 and it is an ACL. Would have been his manager refresh if healthy. This is a GOOD fly by his Sixers.

296435885_237716231237550080 x	That's NOT a good sign, I've never seen Andy Reid disrespected like that by one of his players. This guy(#97) is SUPPOSED to be a LEADER.
296435885_161276666080014336 x	I like that play design, nice run!
296435885_161275189211049984 x	Another order qtr TD for Eli! Can Alex Smith do it again? Giants fight 17-14 #littlebluesucks

296435885_362685775533457408 x	I'm just angry for everyone that is outraged over Riley Cooper. What would be an appropriate punishment?
296435885_327920121739898880 x	Wondering why there is so much negative emotion attached to a player(Geno Smith) that is never played here. Makes you wonder.....
296435885_398238936793096192 x	Wednesday night, home alone, great night to watch some Sixers! #WinlessForWiggins
296435885_397557865072050177 x	Stop his presses, did I just hear MC listen to Iggy as AI?
296435885_172821766740258816 x	I hope Temple gets in his BIG EAST! If you are a Cherry&White alum, what do you think about his possible move?
296435885_161262415319801856 x	Great, now we have to hear how Cruz lost confidence from Nnamdi using him. #littlebluesucks
296435885_275452732465356800 x	Um, that was strange defence by DRC! You're on his 6yd line, why all his cushion. 31-27 Cowgirls
296435885_265658163628494848 x	Still ALIVE, TD DJax! 24-10 #ganggreen
296435885_389450878861983744 x	Now would be a good time to his Dax back there!
296435885_389440510295019520 x	Ok, now let me see if Shady is ok.
296435885_389439120424329218 x	That was a good defencive series by Fletcher. #CaptainObvious #GangGreen
296435885_399641903605743617 x	Hope I'm wrong, will not be his order time.
296435885_399527036425089025 x	he what is up Seth, I do not think either team calls more than 23pts. Teams usually rally behind his backup QB. Birds still win!
296435885_398966767135232000 x	Why is ET taking his headband on his TOP of his head? Hahahaha! #SoNotCool
296435885_394514780423471105 x	That ball changed his Giants player, I think! #ChallengeFlagAlert

296435885_294604902716555266 x	I'd hate Georgia DC Todd Grantham. Don't think he is leaving Georgia though. I like his idea of starting to a 3-4 defense.

296435885_384433869124304896 x	I have no problem with Chip wondering to fight there. Your have to play his percentages, it is a 4qtr game. The D could get a design and out here.
