554695511_396433330268553216 x	he give barbe a chance. I agree with his homer assessment. But I'm not ready to admit manager will not be a good coach.
554695511_396291841718747136 x	he did you hear patrick Roy admit they offered flyers their order round refresh but homer wanted Downie instead? Wth!!!!
554695511_396292403059232768 x	he that is exactly my thoughts!!! I hope to god that is not true. If it is homer needs to go.
554695511_396293268432244736 x	he would be that dumb!! finance
554695511_396295557637230593 x	he big fan of talbot. But I see his potential upgrade. Max was kind of in a strange point with flyers. Hall can turn it.
554695511_396297021344460800 x	he funny I need sleep. Wrote Adler and needed name eager. #wayoff #imanidiot
554695511_396299757779697664 x	he I think read has been good!!
554695511_396303456505704448 x	he yes best here. But I like his living threat he has with couts.Finally cots is playing with talent. And he is been better design
554695511_396305214854422528 x	he def. g need to kiss tonight. He always pass order and never shoots.
554695511_396306012984344576 x	he yes that no look pass to vinny was drunk
554695511_396309765485510657 x	he not that I seen but learned that Downie going LW with g and vinny
554695511_396313097075720192 x	he yes letters spent on his order line really does not help much. In my computer
554695511_396315728019984384 x	he I know man in three years once all those guys are here it will be sick!!!
554695511_396316607494230017 x	he yes I'm starting to believe that morning will be in Philly next year.But hagg has another year MODO deal so I do not know how that works
554695511_396321711114944512 x	he trade to his oilers for picks. #toppicks!! Lola
554695511_396333361108901888 x	he no idea. What would you do?
554695511_396297555270963200 x	he on this team? Mason. Haha that is about it to me.
554695511_395188949280649216 x	he what do you want his eagles to do in next years draft?
554695511_395191710848131072 x	he same! manzil I guess. Whoever needs to be mobile and also needs to have a swagger to him.
554695511_395217075217920002 x	he oh man hard to say. I think he can be but I'm no scout. I love marita but he will not be available, baring injury or trade up
554695511_395219674063208448 x	he hard to admit this early. But I agree with people that admit next years QB is not on his roster.
554695511_395223993919488000 x	he funny yes that is what I said. But I'm an idiot no laugh I think kipper has him starting around 13 or so tb as 2, and mm at design
554695511_394482697336524800 x	Oh poor eagles people about to get bombarded with Byrd to his eagles ?'s since Mort just had it in his hypothetical trades.
554695511_391967456618885120 x	he funny yes I will not put any stock in it. Are they even available? I'd rather have vane to open up space for g #doubtful
554695511_391968174343999488 x	he yes that is his thing. I do not ever want to give up simmer. And have a hard time living with his order round refresh #prongerdeal
554695511_391969672880738305 x	he Jesus! Well you would have to clean major cap space. So we talking jake cob calm probably read Laughton I would think could be
