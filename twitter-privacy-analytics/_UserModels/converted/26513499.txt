26513499_392677565522931712 x	he therefore you should have read other quotes, one chapter in a book != obsession :D
26513499_392680785779515392 x	he his name is enough for it to become bestseller. officaries LCF would be highlighted because of his rivalry,but 'obsession' LOL!!
26513499_392682830880182273 x	he He gave his fine computer (and he is right), he said his best about Becks. Still could not see where is that an 'obsession'.
26513499_392685643874058240 x	he and how exactly is 'Lampard' point due to obsession with city part?
26513499_392690062665601024 x	he haha, we all can see who is bitter. No one needed a dull, diplomatic autobiography from Sir Alex being his that person he is

26513499_392693976186114048 x	he As I said, I do not care what you think of him, it is your opinion, just as his are in his book.I only questioned 'obsessed' part
26513499_392694886542999552 x	he LCF have always been his rank rivals, City were nothing few years ago. Only those who are new to sports think therefore
26513499_392707082664677377 x	he To have a whole chapter about his team you knocked off his perch is not called obsession (maybe due to scouse logic)
26513499_392708685023023104 x	he irony meter just exploded, you lot do not give a fuck about country yet you get set up by his comments?? Geez I give up!!
26513499_392711641579540480 x	he so you thought whole book is about obsession with city by learning just few quotes? Seriously?? this is stupid, good night
