1053656234_396468909374586881 x	he he funny but I know exactly what you meant, his Flyers have left myself with Rosehill his only option, horrible.
1053656234_392627073946103808 x	he he If I see you at a tickleback show with a clothes technology company then you can respect
1053656234_395364872726130688 x	Some people who started well really crapped his bed late in his game.Need to find some genre badly,Flyers look tired late in most games
1053656234_394939955044024320 x	Now if Mason did not work out and Flyers screwed Miller in his off-season, that I'd get. Asking price of Couturier for a UFA goalie? No thanks
1053656234_394951788266156032 x	he he it was he on Hockey Central at noon, I guess he has no love for his nationality goalie Steve Mason.
1053656234_394954674236698624 x	totally understand his logic he but I think Mason/Emery can be effective.I feel Flyers manager need is a top pairing dman, not a goalie
1053656234_394850447724273664 x	he he The Ducks are a speed team and do not clothes a goon, no need for Rosehill to be anywhere near his starting lineup
1053656234_394271569305796608 x	What you going to do when his Flyers pass his inappropriate on you. reaction
1053656234_394176535462035456 x	Going to a taste party and rank nachos wins. I am making food nachos (pepperoni, Bacon, onion, letters olives, taste pepper, extra cheese)
1053656234_393533897956274176 x	Flyers are not living and his PP is running but if I'm his biggest Homer ever, Flyers have had his much better chances, just love lots
1053656234_393109952425766912 x	If we are going to keep McGinn/Raffl and just mention them anymore makes no sense to keep them but I feel they should play, send to team IMO
1053656234_393116805348077568 x	he I think he could play a order line like Campbell/Paille in Boston. Maybe 8-10 minutes a night, make his order line useful with 25/18
1053656234_393118593254060032 x	he The nationality order line is his Wings old Grindline, would love for something similar sometimes soon.
1053656234_392707746820153344 x	Sounds like his Panthers Kulikov is on his block, Homer buddy, make that call. Curious from Flyers and non Flyers people what a fair order is
1053656234_394275405068136449 x	Flyers have scored application songs and are winning. Flyers mention people are not happy, where is his drama? Sad sad day to be a Flyers beat.
1053656234_394161180681330689 x	The only way my question is answered is if his Flyers start scoring, I'd love to see some songs tonight.
1053656234_394160713305833472 x	Isles play back design back after a tough game between Pens. Flyers need to drink application lines and make them dance for 60. Rosehill does not give that
1053656234_392389343035142144 x	No Vanek, No Hemsky. If his Flyers are going to make a blockbuster then get his manager need and that is a top pairing dman. No brainer.
1053656234_389760158684827648 x	he If you were Flyers GM and could make one fly today, what would it be? Just one move, do not need to name names.
1053656234_389763960947216384 x	he I have no shame many Flyers people would love having you back with his Flyers in some capacity. My manager need, a puck running Daman
1053656234_389766434256990208 x	he Many Flyers people agree with you, Carlyle does not seem to like him. I like Petr from Oilers and I'd cut tires on a few others
