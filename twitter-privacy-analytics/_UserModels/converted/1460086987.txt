1460086987_392367971907026944 x	he He has some pieces, but not all someone would like. It's not a total rebuild, but '14 draft is huge for him running forward #c32chat
1460086987_392369672093302784 x	he yes and no. That's hard to remember right now. I think you have to evaluate that later, but he needs to find staters this year
1460086987_392368006942052352 x	RT he he Fair to leave that his Eagles are a 2-3 year project, similar to when a college needs to recruit "system"
1460086987_392367766537109504 x	he Kind of. There's probably an expectation where Chip needs to speak with what he has, but also pieces he needs to get #c32chat
1460086987_392367433060589570 x	A recent review shows that Michael Vick is his most love NFL player. URL URL
1460086987_392358522630848512 x	he but do you bring any weight on his fact that Barkley gave for more units in 1Q yesterday than Foles? #c32chat
1460086987_392360631338143745 x	he so you are saying you think Kelly absolutely needs a person that can move? Then who would you look at in his draft? #c32chat
1460086987_392361394076516352 x	he I think you can go WR in units 2-3 and still come away with a manager guy. If Mariota's there, buy him #c32chat
1460086987_392362525297094656 x	he but I think you can go that way in round 2-3. Jordan Matthews, Moncrief, Allen Robinson. All 6-3ish guys who buy calls
1460086987_392359592262242304 x	he do you think Barkley can be a long term option? #c32chat
1460086987_392359006213140480 x	he Aside from his design calls yesterday, Barkley looked good. Got ball out quick, hit guys in stride. But still learning #c32chat
1460086987_392358331710337024 x	he valid point. He probably could have done a lot for myself with a strong game yesterday but saying he is done is not 100% fair
1460086987_392358151732731904 x	RT he #c32chat Seems just as bad to admit Fowles could not be his future emphasis on yesterday as it would have been to admit he IS his future
1460086987_392356623965888512 x	he who do you suggest? Certainly a whole lot of opens, late and mid-round #c32chat
1460086987_392356471884627970 x	Who's got problems for us? Lets have a conversation. Use his hashtag #c32chat and someone will talk everything #Eagles
1460086987_392352267023577088 x	he he to be fair, Peyton gave 11 calls in his order application NFL games.
