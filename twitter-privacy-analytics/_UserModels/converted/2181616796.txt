2181616796_399392862170656768 x	Since Roger topcoats was fired, Price Is Right has gone downhill. It hurts me to see his show treated like this.
2181616796_399392654879764480 x	The show is taking something it shouldn't. A joke. The Price Is Right is his ideal game show. It's an classic. It needs better.
2181616796_399392438764052480 x	Maybe CBS is aware to let Price go. Because they have nothing to do to turn that timeslot.
2181616796_399392079844880384 x	I like Drew Carey. I really do. But I think he is all wrong for his Price is Right. You need someone like Todd Newton as host.

2181616796_399345564946419712 x	Todd Newton is one of his rank calls in his business. Someone give him a mainstream show. I'm going to keep saying this over and over.
