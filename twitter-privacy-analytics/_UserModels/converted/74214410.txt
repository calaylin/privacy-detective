74214410_388128995587289088 x	Hahaha! So let me get this straight... Hurdle will not fly Pedro up in Game 5, but he will finally stop shifting on Holliday? OK.
74214410_388130569080414208 x	he Hurdle has made a amount amount strange problems in this series. I'd like to see what we could do if we had a great manager.
74214410_388131073537753088 x	he Probably right.
74214410_386234708280881152 x	he I do not believe his manager of my team knows about trying to win a WS. He just needs to be good enough to turn a profit.
74214410_386235620621709312 x	he Definitely, but spent lots of money with his risk of losing in his DS or CS is strange for a man who loves his money.
74214410_386236487227801600 x	he Well if that crowd for his Reds game did not show them how much money they could make, nothing will.
74214410_386228790126317568 x	he Well I'm sure I argued that you were wrong, but I'm happy I was. Still do not have a crazy amount of faith, but more than I did.
74214410_386232204642115584 x	he We traded his last power giving 3B, Aramis, after just 1 year of paying his arbitration deal.
74214410_386231826156503040 x	he Yeah, someone will get that answer after this season. Pedro is available for Arbitration after a 36/100 season.
