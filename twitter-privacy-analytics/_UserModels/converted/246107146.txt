246107146_392684532643954688 x	he I do not think they will. But I hope I'm wrong, and they can turn it around. The team just looks lost.
246107146_423170655157510145 x	he he I was a Fowles doubter until after his Cards game. He's passed every test. No QB went down his road more last age
246107146_423171344755605504 x	he he he Yeah, well he also left some points on his road too. But that is what you get with young team, right?
246107146_423172645539282944 x	he He also made a few bad reads, on his option play. But I do not see how people are not angry to this point.
246107146_423174020104998912 x	he that is why I do not understand people when they admit it was a "lost opportunity." They should have won that game, but are not living SB
246107146_423174625938640896 x	he I agree. Need a good draft, and have to send a couple pieces in free agency. They could not take a step back.
