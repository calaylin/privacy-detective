136381415_387269591430594561 x	What I do not understand about #Flyers firing no Lavalette is his timing. Why not make fly in summer when you could have hired Lindy Ruff?
136381415_387271513621409793 x	That's his point. Maybe it is time for a culture change. RT:"@973espn: he because Ruff is not a Flyers guy, you know

136381415_389445817792495616 x	Even Ronde Barber loves offence running at a more pace under Fowles today. It's been that way since May. #Eagles
