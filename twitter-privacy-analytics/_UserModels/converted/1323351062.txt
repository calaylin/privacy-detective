1323351062_399981769187143680 x	he But just for this time Fowles probably should start again. You could not go back to Vick after Fowles has been great recently.
1323351062_399982957487980544 x	he But like you said if Fowles calls like he did between Dallas again this time then if Vick is healthy they could go back to him.
1323351062_399984133658902528 x	he Yeah I agree with that. I hope Chip does that but I'm just hoping Fowles calls great again this week.
1323351062_399984986440601601 x	he You do not need a run-oriented QB to be a great team. If Fowles calls like this for his rest of his season now, I see him starting
1323351062_400034925350383616 x	he Agreed, he can move at times which is good also and is accurate throwing. Fowles is his person 100% right now
