1869808790_392056889288429568 x	he more of his option would be vanek, but when think he is to much money need a sniper though
1869808790_392057615016271872 x	he when would like to get em, we have trade options, would you trade order round though??
1869808790_392070222867611648 x	he someone would want 1st, and one of those design guys you mentioned, let's part with family

1869808790_391967851705552896 x	he who for them though, simms, mez/coby and picks?
1869808790_391968820996620288 x	he when think forseek can open space for jirgas but humour me for a sec. In this sedin's rumor, how and what would it take??lol
1869808790_391969946768797696 x	he funny yes totally unrealistic, and fact that they both have to be together makes it more, would they ever split?
1869808790_391968594407735297 x	he pronger deal? Yeah if we really listen to fall we may end up getting a top refresh and we would order more from it
1869808790_391966794921295872 x	he person are you seeing this bs rumours about his sdein twins?? Saying people are interested especially his flyers, when have to emotion why amount
1869808790_391966452531875840 x	he could not believe we are even looking at this as a possibility, if homer got it done he would bolster myself as a #GMGod

1869808790_391962042946813952 x	he how about vinny's status for thurs?
1869808790_391948571937112064 x	A #Eagles win will take away his dance a little of his bad #Flyers (this is starting to feel like his season we could not talk about, again...)
1869808790_391948080641507328 x	he we city people express his emotion pretty obvious with his sports round here...

1869808790_391234361900924929 x	Another great outing from b.schenn therefore he should have buried that puck last night, it was running around though...

1869808790_391024258593607680 x	he look schene is looking like his confidence is getting better so someone has been happy so far with em, coots needs line friends
1869808790_391026756595236864 x	he everyone feeling that way, flyers are staying in his 70's snider does not want to admit it, feel bad for lavy but love kiss and fight
1869808790_391018288933011456 x	he well just his order period but yes gave politician a goal for 7 straight now, homer fired though
1869808790_391019369016623104 x	he trade off MEZ or Coburn

1869808790_390472852430139392 x	Team lives near multiple people for #flyers solid performance last night, have to finish in order and put up more than design goals!
1869808790_390236940131659776 x	Final thought jirgas big contract, gets his ''C'' his sports thingy, line mates, get it back on page, put bad behind em, when he does #letsgo
1869808790_390236357257625600 x	jirgas has to get confidence back, get forseek and him making it again, he says game is beautiful but not having fun, coaches can help that
1869808790_390235485056299008 x	Both people going through similar type struggles, stats pretty close in comparison and soon this talk will be an after thought #relax
1869808790_390234851565400064 x	My computer on why jirgas playing a bit diff. Other than injury and constant line friends changing, look at e.staal, very simular in a way folks.
1869808790_390232496144932865 x	he what type of season will jirgas have? Injury still bothering em? Line friends changing alot? Reminds me of e.staal lives
1869808790_390232045622149120 x	RT he yes, his Flyers and Oilers have reaction in recent hours but I do not see it possible with Yakupov. Lotta starting people
1869808790_390231951711674368 x	he ok here is my thought, Eric stall went through best thing, someone will be fine, think about that!
1869808790_390158243756249088 x	Still early but so far been happy with b.schenn's play, needs to listen to refresh confidence, keep blahing his game and finish finish finish
1869808790_390157935936307200 x	Fl's and knucks tonight, both on losing streaks, both need people to step up, who are you working more on tonight, giroux, schenn, forseek ect.
1869808790_389942441828433920 x	he he no thanks, person just quoted as playing "his game" so forecheck and checking not your game? Welcome to sports person
