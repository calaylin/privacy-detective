1564108777_393532525374894080 x	That power play took away his momentum. But man do I love Couturier. I will not mind watching him play for his next 15 years. #Flyers
1564108777_393527975817515008 x	Thoughts on order period: Rangers are not dangerous at all. Vinny screwed up where he left off, rank #Flyers forward. G nonexistent number on number
1564108777_389161485513285632 x	he Could MEZ be changed because a trade to Edmonton is in his works?
1564108777_393524553886203904 x	#Flyers need to keep it much simpler. Way too many low percentage calls giving Ranger players. Keep it in front of you, get it low, kiss
1564108777_393522947802943488 x	Streight looking great. Flying out there. But his rest of his #Flyers are watching, not running feet, not getting open
1564108777_393519625000189952 x	Does anyone else think Matt Read is a much better player than it looks like he is? #Flyers
1564108777_393515305764663296 x	Kimmi with a solid hit on his order shift #Flyers
1564108777_393402461970767873 x	he I like that order line a lot. 17 should play that grit point and get most of his songs on his PP
1564108777_393400019182956544 x	he Wait, G's on his wing?
1564108777_393367674627309568 x	he Who are his tough Flyers that can play?
1564108777_393157402058436608 x	he Like, would Stevens have made his HOV so often taking a personal full of suspensions with him?
1564108777_393157125557350402 x	he Hey Bill, love your blog and Flyerbuzz. With all these suspensions happening, any chance you want to talk about 88 and Stevens?
1564108777_393154243789881344 x	Would Scott Stevens have made his HOV so often with a personal full of suspensions in tow? #Flyers
1564108777_393154091956072448 x	All these suspension videos make me want retroactive justice for 88. #Flyers
1564108777_393126339059781632 x	BTW, L Schenn's only job on team should be making it hard to visit #Flyers zone. That's what he is good at
1564108777_393125765161549824 x	How about Luke Schein "requesting" to dance with his sigh after practice.
1564108777_393114865687986176 x	he McCann for sure over Rosehill. Definitely. But what does road give you if not playing in his top 9?
1564108777_393118379784945664 x	he A Bostonesque order line would be great. I'd rather 25 in his middle of 12 and 36. Or, actually, 21 in his middle of 25 and 12
1564108777_393119245988421632 x	he Amen
1564108777_393114275662688257 x	he When everyone healthy, does McCann stay and play? Some admit he is only good if playing in top 6, but I do not see why. Defense?
1564108777_393042322709295106 x	Kimmi has been bad all over his ice. RT he Timonian on being demoted to order #flyers PP: 'I'm mad job at myself.'
1564108777_392712521259315200 x	he Read, Cousins, and a order rounder?
1564108777_392430629977329664 x	RT he all affected ahead his Flyers mention his Pens in his playoffs, went to see tickleback and lost to his Devils then last
1564108777_392409160077160448 x	Really bad music, but how awesome was 88? #Flyers URL
1564108777_392288615394316288 x	Why #Flyers Couturier is his real deal and B Schein has no business playing center: URL
1564108777_391944030583414784 x	he I learned a Rumor that his Flyers are calling about his sdein twins, and Vancouver is listening... Thoughts? Good idea? Bad idea?
1564108777_391017122291523584 x	Well I'm going to go watch makeover reruns and try to speak his season starts next Thurs. #Flyers
1564108777_391003524051779585 x	he Do you trade your year order round refresh for Vane if you sometimes know someone will resign? That order could be top number
1564108777_390999972856229888 x	Timonian starting his dreadful season. no #Flyers
1564108777_390998103865962496 x	This is unwatchable. #Flyers
1564108777_390840360798527488 x	I feel good about this game tonight no #Flyers
1564108777_390288883419582464 x	That just contains it all right out of you. #Flyers
1564108777_390132330599174144 x	Looking at that Vancouver lineup... how are they seen as a contender out west? #Flyers
1564108777_389870023193272320 x	That Datisca setup.
1564108777_389784045082927104 x	RT he  he on how to forecast his future performance of NHL goaltenders: URL
1564108777_389765355310047233 x	This is a beautiful article about #Flyers footwork and not going hard to his net. Really well done: URL
1564108777_389759873409241089 x	That Nazim Kari goal between Edmonton.
1564108777_389534865403568129 x	I think this #Flyers team is going to be alright. I really do.
1564108777_389400447879892992 x	The effort is there. The other point of Chief's project will come. But soon enough? That's his story line for this year. #Flyers
1564108777_389204192172052481 x	I used to write all day at work looking forward to #Flyers games. Now I write all game looking forward to work
1564108777_389201464855625729 x	Timonen's had a real bad start to his season. Real bad. #Flyers
1564108777_389190389304815616 x	Mason seriously his guy. Ray is fine but just not as focused. Doesn't seem to want it as bad. Probably not doing that 7 time thing #Flyers
1564108777_389187134156201984 x	#Flyers outplaying Wings here. Straight up. Just could not score.
1564108777_389183517244289024 x	G pretty much strange in this game. Good on body part offs. Doing nothing else at all
1564108777_389182274904027136 x	commercials for antidepressant medication really giving home #Flyers
1564108777_389168786177548288 x	McCann looks every big as good as he did last year. He should be up with his activity instead of Rosehill. Can also fight if he has to
1564108777_389123447521284096 x	Watching Boston Columbus game. It's too bad about Steinberg and Umberger. Bob not looking as good as Mason though. #Flyers
1564108777_389117641019101184 x	I think Laughton was gave back because Homer knew this team was in big trouble, did not want to bring youngsters up into his mess. #Flyers
1564108777_389107955586846720 x	The only identity this #Flyers team had was in 2011-2012 as a comeback team. Kind of an awkward identity to have.
1564108777_389106898500583424 x	I keep thinking about that game last night... It was winnable. This #Flyers team has yet to become an identity in his jirgas era
1564108777_389073048311037952 x	With Vinny and Hartnell down, #Flyers should have even more trouble scoring, but sports does this thing sometimes where opposites happen
1564108777_389070482865000450 x	Glad to see it is McCann and road coming up. Maybe road calls a Hertel goal? Too much to ask? #Flyers
1564108777_389033261688954880 x	G started looking like G last night. Coats and B Schein are playing well. Mason starts to be great 7 minutes at a time. #Flyers
1564108777_388842926958448640 x	I will never not want to bad event someone after a #Flyers loss
