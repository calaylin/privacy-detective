19975235_381187956566159360 x	Yay! The man taking his Abington 'A' food board is here! I interested him in a sports picture and everyone who saw it changed up.
19975235_396430881403183104 x	he he let me play guess his attendance. Your estimate?
19975235_396077245527498752 x	he he hi do you know if his game is sold out?
19975235_396263583610580992 x	he just drove by school. Five calls of door added, it appears.
19975235_394559431897133056 x	he Clearly! Looking forward to playoffs. Not sure if I'll be in Fairless Hills. I take 1 for team on Fridays, kiss uncovered games.
19975235_394544190052651008 x	he Well, you might in a week. #notoveryet
19975235_394551376514396160 x	he oh you probably can. And if not you might get another shot in his playoffs! #rivalryweek #itsabouttime
19975235_394554419104456704 x	he congratulations and thank god for this game. We usually have something serious to hype up on his show!
19975235_394555632956616705 x	he That is good stuff! We will probably use it. Interviewing Coach Schmidt on Tuesday for his show. What should I ask?
19975235_394557576442310656 x	he good one. I'm kind of thinking Redskins, going for dead record, have more pressure on them than Pennsbury.
19975235_394558642613407744 x	he That too. Also Schmidt has been giving them hard to play a perfect game. I remember him screaming at 'em at Souderton.
