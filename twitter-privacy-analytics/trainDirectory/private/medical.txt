The NHS Saved my Mother's life after a huge heart attack and gave her 13 more years. #bigupthenhs
After spending the night in hospital & the whole day asleep I'm staying in the bath until I start feeling even remotely human again #bleurgh
At the hospital now. Getting admitted and they're going to induce in a little while.. I'm nervous lol.
i woke up 5 seconds ago to find out my grandmas in the hospital again and I'm scared bc she's 90 and she's been around my whole life :(
My grandpa was diagnosed with cancer and his response was, at least I don't have aids,it melts my heart that he still finds humor in this
for every girl i have hooked up with in the past months i just found out i have aids #imsorry.....
found out her ex gave her an std....never hollerd her again #truestory
I got an STD and was hospitalized. Told everyone I had an ovarian cyst removed. That was how my mom found out I was sexually active.
I sneezed and now I feel sick... I hope it's worse tomorrow, because I'd rather stay at home than go to school.
Tried to hang myself, I only blacked out and wound up in hospital. Overdosed on pills three times before and same story...I just won't leave
And then I blacked out and here I am. Still blackout. Waiting for someone to drive me to the hospital
Please take a moment to pray for my mom. She's in he hospital after having a stroke. My family and I would greatly appreciate your support.
I've noticed that since I was diagnosed with anxiety I have had more nightmares than before.
I was finally diagnosed as having PTSD. I didn’t believe it until they asked if I was married.
I was diagnosed 20 yrs ago with RA. I have been on many different meds for my RA.
when i tell u that i feel depressed its not just a feeling. i was diagnosed with depression so its my whole life now
@Mind_Of_Peace i was diagnosed with anxiety + depression over two years ago and am still forced to take the pills for it. it's ridiculous.
1 year ago today she was diagnosed, now she's cancer free. I have never been so proud. I love you mom :) 
February 13,2013:I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma a type of cancer. February 13,2014: I'm 5 months in remission .. 100% cancer free.
Never, EVER take your health for granted. I had no idea what that meant until I was diagnosed with #ulcerativecolitis. #gratitude
Emotional day today.4yrs since I was first diagnosed. Picture taken on TeenageCancer (TC) ward at BCH with my mom.
Turns out I have a vitamin D deficiency and I was given a supplement to take weekly. Guess who hasn't had a fainting spell since? This girl.
I think I have iron deficiency anemia, hm oh
Having Diabetes has taught me control & patience, but it's still a challenge I live with everyday. @T1Diabetes101
A cure would be nice…but until then, I feel FORTUNATE to live with diabetes in 2014: http://www.diabetesdaily.com/voices/2014/01/7-reasons-its-good-to-live-with-diabetes-in-2014/ …
I still remember, on 2008, got a call my mum was admitted into the hospital for heart attack while i was in MRSM. 
Incase you forgot Im #AmazingArchie and I have Propionic Aciduria its a genetic disorder please google it and follow me to spread awareness
Kind of figured for a couple years but found out today for sure that I have a rare blood disorder 
A lot of people wouldn’t guess this about me but I live with GAD and depression. Mental illness doesn’t discriminate.
I hope i can turn my mental illness into something productive one day. What's the point of suffering if it's for nothing?
A specialist I saw recent calls me and says you have severe severe sleep apnea.
my grandfather had skin cancer removed last week i have a family history of skin cancer yay
I have a mole that's itching. Obviously it's skin cancer. Bury me in my letters. RIP.
To people who still don't get it-I may have Aspergers Syndrome but that doesn't make me mentally incapable or a freak 
It's not always that I don't WANT to change.  It may just be that I don't understand HOW to.  I have #Aspergers.  #Autism
I have Aspergers and survived public high school. Anytime I see an ad for Game of Thrones or Hunger Games, I just think, "Wimps".
I was just recently told that I have #Aspergers. But I'm not sure what it is about me that gives me that diagnosis because I suffer from so much anxiety, depression, and ADD.
Literally think I have chronic fatigue syndrome..
Went to the doctors today. Found out I have Bronchitis. Love not being able to breath! Who need Oxygen! #asthma #bronchitis
Went to the doctor for back problems, doctors found cancer through out his body stage 4 and he didn't even know.

So I went to the doctors and found out I have a abnormal rib cage and that's what's causing my pain in my chest so yay
Confession. I have been flat on my back since Friday p.m. in terrible low back pain. Pretty embarrassing for a Pilates guru.

*How's your health?* Umm.. Pretty bad just like the last time you asked because that's how life-long diseases work.
I can't handle being sick like this anymore, I don't understand how people can live with diseases like Crohns or colitis. 3 weeks is enough.
The partners of those with diseases like #crohns are the true heroes. Do we thank you enough? (thank you so very much)
Feeling some time of way rn  like kinda sick.. I might need to go see a doctor
Feeling like crap today, prolly won't leave my bed...because I'm lazy not cause I'm sick! #collegekid
I ate an apple for the first time in a year last night, and I woke up feeling sick. I guess some things really are just an urban legend.

Today I start back throwing! It's been five long months since my surgery and I couldn't be more excited to pick a ball up again. 
So apparently after my surgery the pharmacist asked if I was allergic to any medication and I responded "no, just to boys".

@dzhray Yes I served 6 years. I was recently diagnosed. I had no clue I had PTSD, or the "instance" that caused it. Work in progress. :)
The one positive memory I have from the day I was diagnosed is my doctor from Kaiser calling to talk me thru MS later when I got home.

@richerdstands I'd suppose. Wasn't officially diagnosed because a doctor only thought I was pushing for adderall pills.
I was just officially diagnosed with tendinitis #iwillsurvive
I'm convinced I have an attention deficit disorder bc I'm trying to find everything to do BUT my mid-term review. Like I need to get my life
I love when people who have never dealt with any kind of emotional disorder illegitimatize the feelings of people who do struggle with them.
Doc said I have 'oppositional defiance disorder' AKA don't tell me what to do
I guess it's true when they say you never recover from and eating disorder or depression. (C)
I have social anxiety disorder and no-one knows or understands why  act a different way from them
Not everyone with an ED is underweight. I have an eating disorder. I am a binge eater. This is my body. #edaw14 pic.twitter.com/1y3DNkIaF0
Decided to turn a negative into a positive. My eating disorder led to healthy eating & fitness. Decided I want to be a nutritionist!
Figures I'd get an anxiety disorder instead of something helpful like an eating disorder.
