She has standards, she refuses to settle..If he's the right guy, he won't leave..#SingleBecause My expectations are too high.I love you, and that's all I really know..No girl deserves to be kept a secret..She acted like it wasn't a big deal, when really it was breaking her heart..Show feelings, get hurt. Be faithful, get cheated on. Show love, get left. Be honest, get lied to. ?Tears on a girls face should feel like bullets to a guys chest..She's hurt. Mentally & emotionally. But everyday, she walks with a smile. Because that's who she is, the girl who never stopped smiling..You might not be the girl everyone wants, but at least you're not the girl everyone's had..This is fucking great.

But you can ignore me too.It's better to have an enemy who honestly says they hate you than to have a friend who's putting you down secretly.You'll get bored of me, annoyed of me, hate me, stop talking to me. You'll leave me eventually, just like everyone else.I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Everyone stop texting me.

Everyone is pissing me off today.
My son just stopped outside the door to his room and said "I forgot the password." Then he sat down and cried. He's 29 and I'm sick of this
Just sitting here crying my heart out😪my mama said what's wrong ? & I just looked at her & broke down even more😕
I justwant to be best friends with somebody who is in the same place in life as I am! Too much to ask for though!
Not in the best place this morning
While you're all going places, meeting people, having abs, getting married, I'm at the corner binge eating and trying to calm the f*** down.
I need a vacation from work
You're only human & therefore you're bound to fuck up, but don't deserve it constantly being brought up & thrown back in your face
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain.
I'll believe you're moving out when it actually happens.
My Life Is Moving Too Quick
Sometimes you have to laugh certain stuff off and keep it moving.
I think it's time to step back and keep moving forward
It's a fuck this shit I'm stopping at Starbucks kind of day.
I'm tired of people saying they want this or they want that. Go out and GET IT instead of sitting at home and whining about it.
Waiting for the day that I can look at you and feel nothing.
Phone still hasn't fucking come
Sittin in my car pondering on going into school.. #fuckit #legooo
love how I'm still at school because no ones picking me up erm
It really annoys me when the bus is late picking me up from JVS.
Not really good at staying asleep alone: ​​'( :/
Why am I staying at this shit school next year 
u make me love u more and u make me proud of everything at now that u did, sorry if I'm not staying so connect with u :( @ddlovato
Staying positive is getting harder and harder. But, at least I can say I'm tried my hardest if it hits the fan.
Loving someone who doesnt love you is like waiting for a ship at the airport.
I'm stuck at work right now and all I want too do is be with you 
My parents are mad at me for getting a flat tire like I can control it. #k
I'm in such a weird mood today getting agitated and annoyed at the slightest things
I hate getting pissed at school because I can't control who I flip on......
Another day of sitting at home getting fat #boredom #food #hungry #neverfull #couchpotato #watchingtv #eating
Damn fuck being sick man, I knew working outside yesterday was gonna fuck me up
Spring break is gonna be whack cause its gonna be freezing. Can't even have a party outside faccck
Crying and crappy outside, sounds for a marvelous day ahead
I've been trying to avoid the fact that today marks 3 months without you here, but it's only making your absence so much worse. I love you👼
Fuck waiting at the bank.. long ass lines and whatnot.
I smile and act like nothing's wrong, it's called dealing with shit and staying strong.
I hate that feeling in my heart.. It's a disease that slowly is killing me.. Why do I feel this? #ewww #shootme
Holly fuck. I'm done with all if this fuck shit. Get it together. I'm not playing the fucking games.
I've had pretty much fuck all to do until this week and now I've got shit loads of work the sun's starting to come out.
All just don't bother me. Pls fuck off. Don't text me don't call me don't find me whosoever. Just fuck off.
Fuck texting, phone calls, tweets, facebook messages & all that other bullshit. I want you here.
i am ok nothing happened for those who actually gave a fuck about me yesterday when i was about to end it all lol
And I really don't give a fuck how anybody feels about me. Y'all gone wish you supported when I needed it
Just cuz theres that 1 guy that'll always spark my interest doesnt mean others are out of the equation. I just choose to stay out of it all.
I hate it when I'm having a bad day and someone takes it personally. Like no I hate myself, not you. Get over yourself.
i feel like all that was useless
I felt so worthless and useless all day.. 😔
@drivebytruckers I'm useless. #englishoceans and hit repeat all. loving it!  #dbt
All day long... People told me that I'm useless...
I've try to move on. But it was useless. So I've decided to forgot all of this. And just go on with my old life.
You never know who's lying that's why trust is so deadly because when you trust you're basically giving that person all of who you are
Literally just got home from the hospital & people are already visiting. Not okay.
R.I.P. to the people who have hurt me, who are disrespectful, and not so decent memories some people left me. Because it's all dead to me.
I see all of these people my age who are happy who always smile who never cry and I wonder how the fuck do you do it
Sometimes the strongest people are the ones who love beyond all faults, cry behind closed doors and fight battles that nobody knows about.
Made some changes in my life, don't regret none of them so if you ain't heard from me then you probably one of them.
I hate when bitches refer to you as “white boy". Ho.Shut.The.Fuck.Up.
Oomf is srsly starting to irritate me . Fucking leave me alone .
I'm too angry to be at work. But it seems everyone know to leave me alone
LOLZ I love how everyone hates me so much they just leave me sitting at lunch alone.
Not in the mood to deal with stupid people
I don't want to deal with any you of stupid people gah I hate this school
Cheating is one thing. Lying is another. But having everyone know you are being unfaithful while having your partner look stupid, is awful
In a pissed off mood now
Punching a wall seems great when you're upset... Just think I'm about to break my knuckles
need to start telling more people what's wrong with me, otherwise I'll just keep feeling like this
That mood where you're just like: Fuck the fuck off, you annoying fucking fucker!
Idk why everyone hates me like everyone is unfollowing me and i hate my fucking life my parents are fucking crazy so if you want me gone bye
I just shaved him down so we could see the spots and I'm so angry right now they don't deserve this
Honestly, the only person that can make you angry is YOU.
My mama making me angry
I feel like I have no freedom.
Having a breakdown everyday bc school and stress and looks and boys and money and looks and weight and the future and love and family ugh
Why does prom have to be so much work and stress and ugh
School work overload. ugh #stress
If everything happens for a reason then why the fuck is this happening?
Lord please Tell me Why this Is happening to me
I can't take this much longer, I'm bored as hell; and it's spring break
I can't take this shit anymore.
Don't feel sad over someone who gave up on you, feel sorry for them because they gave up on someone who would have never given up on them.
I know you won't see this but I wanted to tell you how much I love you & that you make me smile whenever I'm sad💕
How do I manage to get so many people to hate me..? #ugh
I hate when random ppl ask how I am and I say "good you?" And they actually tell me. Like just say good ugh
I feel so terrible. Why am I ill all the time? It's stupid and I hate it ugh
Ugh. I hate going to get my car looked at. I never know what they're talking about
Ugh I hate moving
goodnight im so depressed
Being ignored is so much worse than arguing
So depressed because @ddlovato will never notice me im not special enough 
the thing is if ppl were genuinely depressed they wouldnt post it everywhere it pisses me off
stressed, depressed & boy band obsessed <<<<
I talk about good stuff too. but you only latch on to the days when I'm mad or depressed. (granted thats a lot) but its not all there is!
If this lady ask me one more time about her credit card I'm going to scream.
Why am i such a lonely fuck …oh ya dats right my bf hates me :'(
I fuck everything good in my life. Everything. This is why I'm lonely as fuck.
IM SO LONELY WHY ISNT ANYONE OVER I HAVE A FREE HOUSE GODDAMN
Like actually why is my future success going to be based off how well I do as a confused & lonely & overall incompetent college student?
The only reason why I continued to associate w/individuals who didn't benefit me was bc I was lonely. I wasn't comfortable being w/myself.
I'm just so far past done with this week..

I can be so mad at my mom, but I get over it. Sign of maturity. She isn't always gonna be around, that's why I cherish the time with her.

Hearing my parents fight is the worst thing to wake up too ugh
Ugh my parents are literally ruining my life pic.twitter.com/8WN94WOBlj
there's nothing worse than sitting in the car with your parents and they bring up boys. like ugh no can you not?
Maybe I should kill myself 
well looks like I should just kill myself now since Minnesota's coming here on a Tuesday and I teach on Tuesdays.
I'm too fat to go to work today i should just kill myself and then no one will be staring at how fat i am .
My mom said she seen my twitter...idk if I should kill myself right now or............right now. Lol :/
Wonder why I hate my life
I really hate seeing people I care about walk out my life, eventually I'll stop trying to keep them close and let them leave. . .
I hate it when ppl say I "have" to. in reality I dnt have. to the worst thing that would happen? im grounded big deal I have no life anyways
Im so bored and i hate school... what is life
I love you, but I hate you. I miss you, but I'm better off without you. I want you out of my life, but I never want to let you go.	
life.. I don't want anybody to hate me, think that I'm a bad person, or say that I'm not nice to anybody..But to him, I'm all of that.. :'(

Lesson learnt for the millionth time... don't leave work until the day before it's due! 1000 words done so far today #stressed #unilife
I have so much to do and so little time to do it #Stressed
going somewhere tranquil and just sitting in ur car and looking at the stars sounds so nice right now #stressed
Once I make it through today, I'll be able to curl up in bed and relax for a week #stressed
Can this day be over with already? #Stressed😣
aaaaaah graduation requirements super hassle 😓 #stressed
I actually cried today because of how badly I don't want to go to school 😭😭😭😭 #stressed
Why am i even crying? Fck this movie. Ugh
Trying to walk as fast as possible and get out of people's way at school and I'm currently crying inside
I'm in so much pain and I can't talk about it without crying and I have a client and its so awkward
I'm just casually crying in my room repeating "my wife is flawless" over and over pic.twitter.com/FujPxe1clH
Everything we wanted never happened but it seems to be happening to every one around us. 😔 #upset
