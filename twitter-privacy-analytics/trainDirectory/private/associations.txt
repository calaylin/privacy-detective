I've never met a more down to earth and humble girl than my sister. I only wish I could be half the person she is.
I thought my parents getting a divorce would stop the fighting but I guess not
Your parents advise you to divorce your wife & they'll support you but then closed the door on you when you asked to stay the night? Upset??
After going through my parents divorce I NEVER want that to happen to me
Finally figured out the worst part of divorce... When your parents start dating
So done with my parents divorce and all my other unfortunate events that have been occurring
I wonder how different my life would be if my parents never got a divorce..
i am so sad bc mr braito told me about when his parents got a divorce and stay together for the kids by blink makes him cry oh
my parents argue everyday. its mostly related to financial probs. these arguments are tiring and honestly i think a divorce is best
I put my pants on like anybody else, blaming myself for my parents' divorce.
31 years ago today I was born. I was a beautiful baby, so much so that when my parents saw me, they put off their divorce by 3 more years.
The cake my brother and I made for our parents... they're getting a divorce.
Parents are almost done their divorce but they still talk on the phone like friends all the time and mom stays at dad's house when shes in q

My step is so mean my mom's getting a divorce might have to move from my friends :'( my mom's future husband is @Real_Liam_Payne
#LRT id be salty if he just divorced me... But there wouldn't be a point to getting a divorce though
You have to give to receive ladies. My wife won't be am exception. 
I'd kill my wife if she brought sour cream in my goddamn house foh
I'm preparing my brothers so that when they move in w/their wife or gf they don't have unrealistic expectations of them.
No girl is better wife material than my girl
Once I'm married if my husband tries to argue with me when he's clearly wrong I'm just going to yell whisper "a happy wife is a happy life"
Ugh my boyfriends so fuckin hard headed I should watch what I tell him... Think it thoroughly before saying anything around him. Smh
