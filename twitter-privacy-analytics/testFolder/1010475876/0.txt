@tpanotchCSN it's time for Giroux to sit on the bench for power plays.im sick of his act this year.
@LHillaryCSN we have a way of making every goalie look like a Vezina winner.#putthepuckinthenet
@NHLFlyers Giroux no goal,again.broken record this year.
@JimJPhilly Giroux is just not the player he was last year.That extra letter on the sweater is a Flyer curse.
RT @MadelnCanada: I don't always... http://t.co/WxEG13yl
@LHillaryCSN no news yet on Erskine suspension
@tpanotchCSN are u hinting at another coaching change if the losing continues,which it will.
@JohnBorukCSN maybe he will trade our captain and our leading goal scorer again.cuz that worked out well for LA.
@JohnBorukCSN I agree with you,That's why I say Talbot and Rusty have no business in the lineup.Play the kids.
@tpanotchCSN woulda been nice if Bryz bail him out,there.Soft backhander squeezes thru?
@AnthonySan37 Coburn and L. Shenn having awful games.
@JohnBorukCSN terrible power play is on him,can't win a damn face off to save his life,he is totally embarrassed by his play.
@tpanotchCSN absolutely horrible game by our captain.thats 2 in a row.that can't happen.
@tpanotchCSN Giroux has been awful!
@AnthonySan37 that's how I want my captain to lead,scream at the refs and take cheap penalties.Cmon man.
